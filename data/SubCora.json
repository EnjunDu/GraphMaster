    "text": "Title: The megaprior heuristic for discovering protein sequence patterns  \nAbstract: Several computer algorithms for discovering patterns in groups of protein sequences are in use that are based on fitting the parameters of a statistical model to a group of related sequences. These include hidden Markov model (HMM) algorithms for multiple sequence alignment, and the MEME and Gibbs sampler algorithms for discovering motifs. These algorithms are sometimes prone to producing models that are incorrect because two or more patterns have been combined. The statistical model produced in this situation is a convex combination (weighted average) of two or more different models. This paper presents a solution to the problem of convex combinations in the form of a heuristic based on using extremely low variance Dirichlet mixture priors as part of the statistical model. This heuristic, which we call the megaprior heuristic, increases the strength (i.e., decreases the variance) of the prior in proportion to the size of the sequence dataset. This causes each column in the final model to strongly resemble the mean of a single component of the prior, regardless of the size of the dataset. We describe the cause of the convex combination problem, analyze it mathematically, motivate and describe the implementation of the megaprior heuristic, and show how it can effectively eliminate the problem of convex combinations in protein sequence pattern discovery.

Preference: Oral presentation Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Channel Allocation in\nAbstract: In cellular telephone systems, an important problem is to dynamically allocate the communication resource (channels) so as to maximize service in a stochastic caller environment. This problem is naturally formulated as a dynamic programming problem and we use a reinforcement learning (RL) method to find dynamic channel allocation policies that are better than previous heuristic solutions. The policies obtained perform well for a broad variety of call traffic patterns. We present results on a large cellular system In cellular communication systems, an important problem is to allocate the communication resource (bandwidth) so as to maximize the service provided to a set of mobile callers whose demand for service changes stochastically. A given geographical area is divided into mutually disjoint cells, and each cell serves the calls that are within its boundaries (see Figure 1a). The total system bandwidth is divided into channels, with each channel centered around a frequency. Each channel can be used simultaneously at different cells, provided these cells are sufficiently separated spatially, so that there is no interference between them. The minimum separation distance between simultaneous reuse of the same channel is called the channel reuse constraint . When a call requests service in a given cell either a free channel (one that does not violate the channel reuse constraint) may be assigned to the call, or else the call is blocked from the system; this will happen if no free channel can be found. Also, when a mobile caller crosses from one cell to another, the call is \"handed off\" to the cell of entry; that is, a new free channel is provided to the call at the new cell. If no such channel is available, the call must be dropped/disconnected from the system. One objective of a channel allocation policy is to allocate the available channels to calls so that the number of blocked calls is minimized. An additional objective is to minimize the number of calls that are dropped when they are handed off to a busy cell. These two objectives must be weighted appropriately to reflect their relative importance, since dropping existing calls is generally more undesirable than blocking new calls. with approximately 70 49 states.",

    "text": "Title: Online Learning versus O*ine Learning  \nAbstract: We present an off-line variant of the mistake-bound model of learning. Just like in the well studied on-line model, a learner in the offline model has to learn an unknown concept from a sequence of elements of the instance space on which he makes \"guess and test\" trials. In both models, the aim of the learner is to make as few mistakes as possible. The difference between the models is that, while in the on-line model only the set of possible elements is known, in the off-line model the sequence of elements (i.e., the identity of the elements as well as the order in which they are to be presented) is known to the learner in advance. We give a combinatorial characterization of the number of mistakes in the off-line model. We apply this characterization to solve several natural questions that arise for the new model. First, we compare the mistake bounds of an off-line learner to those of a learner learning the same concept classes in the on-line scenario. We show that the number of mistakes in the on-line learning is at most a log n factor more than the off-line learning, where n is the length of the sequence. In addition, we show that if there is an off-line algorithm that does not make more than a constant number of mistakes for each sequence then there is an online algorithm that also does not make more than a constant number of mistakes. The second issue we address is the effect of the ordering of the elements on the number of mistakes of an off-line learner. It turns out that there are sequences on which an off-line learner can guarantee at most one mistake, yet a permutation of the same sequence forces him to err on many elements. We prove, however, that the gap, between the off-line mistake bounds on permutations of the same sequence of n-many elements, cannot be larger than a multiplicative factor of log n, and we present examples that obtain such a gap.

These methods are demonstrated on the globin family, the protein kinase catalytic domain, and the EF-hand calcium binding motif. In each case the parameters of an HMM are estimated from a training set of unaligned sequences. After the HMM is built, it is used to obtain a multiple alignment of all the training sequences. It is also used to search the SWISS-PROT 22 database for other sequences that are members of the given protein family, or contain the given domain. The HMM produces multiple alignments of good quality that agree closely with the alignments produced by programs that incorporate three-dimensional structural information. When employed in discrimination tests (by examining how closely the sequences in a database fit the globin, kinase and EF-hand HMMs), the HMM is able to distinguish members of these families from non-members with a high degree of accuracy. Both the HMM and PRO-FILESEARCH (a technique used to search for relationships between a protein sequence and multiply aligned sequences) perform better in these tests than PROSITE (a dictionary of sites and patterns in proteins). The HMM appears to have a slight advantage ",

In addition, when two eyes innervate the same target structure, the two sets of fibres segregate to form ocular dominance stripes. Experimental evidence from the frog and goldfish suggests that these two phenomena may be subserved by the same mechanisms. We present a computational model that addresses the formation of both topography and ocular dominance. The model is based on a form of competitive learning with subtractive enforcement of a weight normalization rule. Inputs to the model are distributed patterns of activity presented simultaneously in both eyes. An important aspect of this model is that ocular dominance segregation can occur when the two eyes are positively correlated, whereas previous models have tended to assume zero or negative correlations between the eyes. This allows investigation of the dependence of the pattern of stripes on the degree of correlation between the eyes: we find that increasing correlation leads to narrower stripes. Experiments are suggested to test this prediction.",

Specifically, we focus on learning in the probability approximately correct model as defined by Valiant. Two of the most widely studied models of noise in this setting have been classification noise and malicious errors. However, a more realistic model combining the two types of noise has not been formalized. We define a learning environment based on a natural combination of these two noise models. We first show that hypothesis testing is possible in this model. We next describe a simple technique for learning in this model, and then describe a more powerful technique based on statistical query learning. We show that the noise tolerance of this improved technique is roughly optimal with respect to the desired learning accuracy and that it provides a smooth tradeoff between the tolerable amounts of the two types of noise. Finally, we show that statistical query simulation yields learning algorithms for other combinations of noise models, thus demonstrating that statistical query specification truly An important goal of research in machine learning is to determine which tasks can be automated, and for those which can, to determine their information and computation requirements. One way to answer these questions is through the development and investigation of formal models of machine learning which capture the task of learning under plausible assumptions. In this work, we consider the formal model of learning from examples called \"probably approximately correct\" (PAC) learning as defined by Valiant [Val84]. In this setting, a learner attempts to approximate an unknown target concept simply by viewing positive and negative examples of the concept. An adversary chooses, from some specified function class, a hidden f0; 1g-valued target function defined over some specified domain of examples and chooses a probability distribution over this domain. The goal of the learner is to output in both polynomial time and with high probability, an hypothesis which is \"close\" to the target function with respect to the distribution of examples. The learner gains information about the target function and distribution by interacting with an example oracle. At each request by the learner, this oracle draws an example randomly according to the hidden distribution, labels it according to the hidden target function, and returns the labelled example to the learner. A class of functions F is said to be PAC learnable if captures the generic fault tolerance of a learning algorithm.",

Yet, in practice, most Bayesian analyses are performed with so-called \"noninfor-mative\" priors, that is, priors constructed by some formal rule. We review the plethora of techniques for constructing such priors, and discuss some of the practical and philosophical issues that arise when they are used. We give special emphasis to Jeffreys's rules and discuss the evolution of his point of view about the interpretation of priors, away from unique representation of ignorance toward the notion that they should be chosen by convention. We conclude that the problems raised by the research on priors chosen by formal rules are serious and may not be dismissed lightly; when sample sizes are small (relative to the number of parameters being estimated) it is dangerous to put faith in any \"default\" solution; but when asymptotics take over, Jeffreys's rules and their variants remain reasonable choices.

The approach focuses on combinations of confldent, possibly overlapping, concepts with an original stochastic complexity formula. The focusing is e-cient because it is organized as a simulated annealing-based beam search.

Little research effort has been directed towards the kinds of situation assessment, evaluation, and assimilation processes that facilitate the exploration of ideas and the elaboration and redefinition of problems that are crucial to creative design. Also, their typically rigid control structures do not facilitate the kinds of strategic control and opportunism inherent in creative reasoning. In this paper, we describe the types of behavior we would like case-based design systems to support, based on a study of designers working on a mechanical engineering problem.

Sensory input is processed by inverting a model that generates patterns from hidden variables using top-down connections. The inversion process is iterative, utilizing a negative feedback loop that depends on an error signal propagated by bottom-up connections. The error signal is also used to learn the generative model from examples. The algorithm is benchmarked against principal component analysis in In his doctrine of unconscious inference, Helmholtz argued that perceptions are formed by the interaction of bottom-up sensory data with top-down expectations. According to one interpretation of this doctrine, perception is a procedure of sequential hypothesis testing. We propose a new algorithm, called up-propagation, that realizes this interpretation in layered neural networks. It uses top-down connections to generate hypotheses, and bottom-up connections to revise them. It is important to understand the difference between up-propagation and its ancestor, the backpropagation algorithm[1]. Backpropagation is a learning algorithm for recognition models. As shown in Figure 1a, bottom-up connections recognize patterns, while top-down connections propagate an error signal that is used to learn the recognition model. In contrast, up-propagation is an algorithm for inverting and learning generative models, as shown in Figure 1b. Top-down connections generate patterns from a set of hidden variables. Sensory input is processed by inverting the generative model, recovering hidden variables that could have generated the sensory data. This operation is called either pattern recognition or pattern analysis, depending on the meaning of the hidden variables. Inversion of the generative model is done iteratively, through a negative feedback loop driven by an error signal from the bottom-up connections. The error signal is also used for learning the connections experiments on images of handwritten digits.",

    "text": "Title: Competitive Anti-Hebbian Learning of Invariants  \nAbstract: Instance-based learning methods explicitly remember all the data that they receive. They usually have no training phase, and only at prediction time do they perform computation. Then, they take a query, search the database for similar datapoints and build an on-line local model (such as a local average or local regression) with which to predict an output value. In this paper we review the advantages of instance based methods for autonomous systems, but we also note the ensuing cost: hopelessly slow computation as the database grows large. We present and evaluate a new way of structuring a database and a new algorithm for accessing it that maintains the advantages of instance-based learning. Earlier attempts to combat the cost of instance-based learning have sacrificed the explicit retention of all data, or been applicable only to instance-based predictions based on a small number of near neighbors or have had to re-introduce an explicit training phase in the form of an interpolative data structure. Our approach builds a multiresolution data structure to summarize the database of experiences at all resolutions of interest simultaneously. This permits us to query the database with the same exibility as a conventional linear search, but at greatly reduced computational cost.",

    "text": "Title: Sampling from Multimodal Distributions Using Tempered Transitions  \nAbstract: Technical Report No. 9421, Department of Statistics, University of Toronto Abstract. I present a new Markov chain sampling method appropriate for distributions with isolated modes. Like the recently-developed method of \"simulated tempering\", the \"tempered transition\" method uses a series of distributions that interpolate between the distribution of interest and a distribution for which sampling is easier. The new method has the advantage that it does not require approximate values for the normalizing constants of these distributions, which are needed for simulated tempering, and can be tedious to estimate. Simulated tempering performs a random walk along the series of distributions used. In contrast, the tempered transitions of the new method move systematically from the desired distribution, to the easily-sampled distribution, and back to the desired distribution. This systematic movement avoids the inefficiency of a random walk, an advantage that unfortunately is cancelled by an increase in the number of interpolating distributions required. Because of this, the sampling efficiency of the tempered transition method in simple problems is similar to that of simulated tempering. On more complex distributions, however, simulated tempering and tempered transitions may perform differently. Which is better depends on the ways in which the interpolating distributions are \"deceptive\". ",

We argue that the regulation process should be improved with growing experience. Therefore mental models are needed which facilitate the re-use of previous regulation processes. We will satisfy this requirement by describing a case-based approach to Introspection Planning which utilises previous experience obtained during reasoning at the meta-level and at the object level. The introspection plans used in this approach support various metacognitive tasks which are identified by the generation of self-questions. As an example of introspection planning, the metacognitive behaviour of our system, IULIAN, is described. ",

On the assumption that an appropriate bias for a knowledge representation language is also an appropriate bias for learning in this domain, we have developed a theory revision method that operates directly on a fault hierarchy. This task presents several challenges: A typical training instance is missing most feature values, and the pattern of missing features is significant, rather than merely an effect of noise. Moreover, the accuracy of a candidate theory is measured by considering both the sequence of tests required to arrive at a diagnosis and its agreement with the diagnostic endpoints provided by an expert. This paper first describes the algorithm for theory revision of fault hierarchies that was designed to address these challenges, then discusses its application in knowledge base maintenance and reports on experiments that use to revise a fielded diagnostic system.

In this paper we propose a different approach for bounding the generalization error after the data has been observed. A self-bounding learning algorithm is an algorithm which, in addition to the hypothesis that it outputs, outputs a reliable upper bound on the generalization error of this hypothesis.

    "text": "Title: Markov Decision Processes in Large State Spaces  \nAbstract: In this paper we propose a new framework for studying Markov decision processes (MDPs), based on ideas from statistical mechanics. The goal of learning in MDPs is to find a policy that yields the maximum expected return over time. In choosing policies, agents must therefore weigh the prospects of short-term versus long-term gains. We study a simple MDP in which the agent must constantly decide between exploratory jumps and local reward mining in state space. The number of policies to choose from grows exponentially with the size of the state space, N . We view the expected returns as defining an energy landscape over policy space. Methods from statistical mechanics are used to analyze this landscape in the thermodynamic limit N ! 1. We calculate the overall distribution of expected returns, as well as the distribution of returns for policies at a fixed Hamming distance from the optimal one. We briefly discuss the problem of learning optimal policies from empirical estimates of the expected return. As a first step, we relate our findings for the entropy to the limit of high-temperature learning. Numerical simulations support the theoretical results. ",

In this paper, we propose a formal notion of context-specific independence (CSI), based on regularities in the conditional probability tables (CPTs) at a node. We present a technique, analogous to (and based on) d-separation, for determining when such independence holds in a given network. We then focus on a particular qualitative representation schemetree-structured CPTs for capturing CSI. We suggest ways in which this representation can be used to support effective inference algorithms. In particular, we present a structural decomposition of the resulting network which can improve the performance of clustering algorithms, and an alternative algorithm based on cutset conditioning.",

Originating in the US, the basic idea and underlying theories have spread to other continents, and we are now within a period of highly active research in case-based reasoning in Europe, as well. This paper gives an overview of the foundational issues related to case-based reasoning, describes some of the leading methodological approaches within the field, and exemplifies the current state through pointers to some systems. Initially, a general framework is defined, to which the subsequent descriptions and discussions will refer. The framework is influenced by recent methodologies for knowledge level descriptions of intelligent systems. The methods for case retrieval, reuse, solution testing, and learning are summarized, and their actual realization is discussed in the light of a few example systems that represent different CBR approaches. We also discuss the role of case-based methods as one type of reasoning and learning method within an integrated system architecture. ",

The expectation is: the \"simpler\" the networks, the better the generalization on test data (! Occam's razor). Previous implementations, however, use measures for \"simplicity\" that lack the power, universality and elegance of those based on Kolmogorov complexity and Solomonoff's algorithmic probability. Likewise, most previous approaches (especially those of the \"Bayesian\" kind) suffer from the problem of choosing appropriate priors. This paper addresses both issues. It first reviews some basic concepts of algorithmic complexity theory relevant to machine learning, and how the Solomonoff-Levin distribution (or universal prior) deals with the prior problem. The universal prior leads to a probabilistic method for finding \"algorithmically simple\" problem solutions with high generalization capability. The method is based on Levin complexity (a time-bounded generalization of Kolmogorov complexity) and inspired by Levin's optimal universal search algorithm. For a given problem, solution candidates are computed by efficient \"self-sizing\" programs that influence their own runtime and storage size. The probabilistic search algorithm finds the \"good\" programs (the ones quickly computing algorithmically probable solutions fitting the training data). Simulations focus on the task of discovering \"algorithmically simple\" neural networks with low Kolmogorov complexity and high generalization capability. It is demonstrated that the method, at least with certain toy problems where it is computationally feasible, can lead to generalization results unmatchable by previous neural net algorithms. Much remains do be done, however, to make large scale applications and \"incremental learning\" feasible.",

In this paper, we show that this phenomenon is related to the distribution of margins of the training examples with respect to the generated voting classification rule, where the margin of an example is simply the difference between the number of correct votes and the maximum number of votes received by any incorrect label. We show that techniques used in the analysis of Vapnik's support vector classifiers and of neural networks with small weights can be applied to voting methods to relate the margin distribution to the test error. We also show theoretically and experimentally that boosting is especially effective at increasing the margins of the training examples.

This task constitutes a difficult control problem if the parameters of the cart-pole system are not known precisely or are variable. It also forms the basis of an even more complex control-learning problem if the controller must learn the proper actions for successfully balancing the pole given only the current state of the system and a failure signal when the pole angle from the vertical becomes too great or the cart exceeds one of the boundaries placed on its position. The approach presented is demonstrated to be effective for the real-time control of a small, self-contained mini-robot, specially outfitted for the task.

Hoeffding Races is a technique for finding a good model for the data by quickly discarding bad models, and concentrating the computational effort at differentiating between the better ones.

This chapter considers the question of what constitutes an appropriate general-purpose learning mechanism. We are interested in mechanisms that might explain and reproduce the rich variety of learning capabilities of humans, ranging from learning perceptual-motor skills such as how to ride a bicycle, to learning highly cognitive tasks such as how to play chess. Research on learning in fields such as cognitive science, artificial intelligence, neurobiology, and statistics has led to the identification of two distinct classes of learning methods: inductive and analytic. Inductive methods, such as neural network Backpropagation, learn general laws by finding statistical correlations and regularities among a large set of training examples. In contrast, analytical methods, such as Explanation-Based Learning, acquire general laws from many fewer training examples. They rely instead on prior knowledge to analyze individual training examples in detail, then use this analysis to distinguish relevant example features from the irrelevant. The question considered in this chapter is how to best combine inductive and analytical learning in an architecture that seeks to cover the range of learning exhibited by intelligent systems such as humans. We present a specific learning mechanism, Explanation Based Neural Network learning (EBNN), that blends these two types of learning, and present experimental results demonstrating its ability to learn control strategies for a mobile robot using ",

However, in complex domains induction over the whole problem space is often not possible or too time consuming. In this paper, an approach is presented which (owing to a close interaction with the CBR part) attempts to induce rules only for a particular context, i.e. for a problem just being solved by a CBR-oriented system.

Contrary to supervised learning, based usually on gradient descent techniques, RL does not require any model or sensitivity function of the process. Hence, RL can be applied to systems that are poorly understood, uncertain, nonlinear or for other reasons untractable with conventional methods. In reinforcement learning, the overall controller performance is evaluated by a scalar measure, called reinforcement. Depending on the type of the control task, reinforcement may represent an evaluation of the most recent control action or, more often, of an entire sequence of past control moves. In the latter case, the RL system learns how to predict the outcome of each individual control action. This prediction is then used to adjust the parameters of the controller. The mathematical background of RL is closely related to optimal control and dynamic programming. This paper gives a comprehensive overview of the RL methods and presents an application to the attitude control of a satellite. Some well known applications from the literature are reviewed as well.

This paper provides a qualitative explanation of the improved behavior of HGP, based on an analysis of the evolution process from the dual perspective of diversity and causality. From a static point of view, the use of an HGP approach enables the manipulation of a population of higher diversity programs. Higher diversity increases the exploratory ability of the genetic search process, as demonstrated by theoretical and experimental fitness distributions and expanded structural complexity of individuals. From a dynamic point of view, an analysis of the causality of the crossover operator suggests that HGP discovers and exploits useful structures in a bottom-up, hierarchical manner. Diversity and causality are complementary, affecting exploration and exploitation in genetic search. Unlike other machine learning techniques that need extra machinery to control the tradeoff between them, HGP automatically trades off exploration and exploitation. ",

The simulations reported in this paper show how size selectivity could develop through Hebbian self-organization, and how receptive fields of different sizes could organize into columns like those for orientation and ocular dominance. The lateral connections in the network self-organize cooperatively and simultaneously with the receptive field sizes, and produce patterns of lateral connectivity that closely follow the receptive field organization. Together with our previous work on ocular dominance and orientation selectivity, these results suggest that a single Hebbian self-organizing process can give rise to all the major receptive field properties in the visual cortex, and also to structured patterns of lateral interactions, some of which have been verified experimentally and others predicted by the model. The model also suggests a functional role for the self-organized structures: The afferent receptive fields develop a sparse coding of the visual input, and the recurrent lateral interactions eliminate redundancies in cortical activity patterns, allowing the cortex to efficiently process massive amounts of visual information.

A MCMC scheme which samples over this joint distribution can lead to substantial gains in efficiency compared to standard approaches.

In addition to reviewing the Swendsen-Wang algorithm and its generalizations, this paper introduces a new auxiliary variable method called partial decoupling. Two applications in Bayesian image analysis are considered. The first is a binary classification problem in which partial decoupling out performs SW and single site Metropolis. The second is a PET reconstruction which uses the gray level prior of Geman and McClure (1987).

The algorithm is employed to obtain a noncon-vex piecewise-linear function for separating points representing measurements made on fine needle aspirates taken from benign and malignant human breasts. A computer program trained on 369 samples has correctly diagnosed each of 45 new samples encountered and is currently in use at the University of Wisconsin Hospitals. 1. Introduction.

One cannot escape the latter question, one of temporal structure, when considering the perception of musical meter. We view the perception of metrical structure as a dynamic process where the temporal organization of external musical events synchronizes, or entrains, a listeners internal processing mechanisms. This article introduces a novel connectionist unit, based upon a mathematical model of entrainment, capable of phase and frequency-locking to periodic components of incoming rhythmic patterns. Networks of these units can self-organize temporally structured responses to rhythmic patterns. The resulting network behavior embodies the perception of metrical structure. The article concludes with a discussion of the implications of our approach for theories of metrical structure and musical expectancy. ",

Most of these packages use the generational model inspired by GENESIS. A few have adopted the steady-state model used in Genitor. Unfortunately, they have some deficiencies when working with order-based problems such as packing, routing, and scheduling. This paper describes LibGA, which was developed specifically for order-based problems, but which also works easily with other kinds of problems. It offers an easy to use `user-friendly' interface and allows comparisons to be made between both generational and steady-state genetic algorithms for a particular problem. It includes a variety of genetic operators for reproduction, crossover, and mutation. LibGA makes it easy to use these operators in new ways for particular applications or to develop and include new operators. Finally, it offers the unique new feature of a dynamic generation gap. ",

    "text": "Title: Convergence-Zone Episodic Memory: Analysis and Simulations  \nAbstract: Human episodic memory provides a seemingly unlimited storage for everyday experiences, and a retrieval system that allows us to access the experiences with partial activation of their components. The system is believed to consist of a fast, temporary storage in the hippocampus, and a slow, long-term storage within the neocortex. This paper presents a neural network model of the hippocampal episodic memory inspired by Damasio's idea of Convergence Zones. The model consists of a layer of perceptual feature maps and a binding layer. A perceptual feature pattern is coarse coded in the binding layer, and stored on the weights between layers. A partial activation of the stored features activates the binding pattern, which in turn reactivates the entire stored pattern. For many configurations of the model, a theoretical lower bound for the memory capacity can be derived, and it can be an order of magnitude or higher than the number of all units in the model, and several orders of magnitude higher than the number of binding-layer units. Computational simulations further indicate that the average capacity is an order of magnitude larger than the theoretical lower bound, and making the connectivity between layers sparser causes an even further increase in capacity. Simulations also show that if more descriptive binding patterns are used, the errors tend to be more plausible (patterns are confused with other similar patterns), with a slight cost in capacity. The convergence-zone episodic memory therefore accounts for the immediate storage and associative retrieval capability and large capacity of the hippocampal memory, and shows why the memory encoding areas can be much smaller than the perceptual maps, consist of rather coarse computational units, and be only sparsely connected to the perceptual maps.

There are two challenges that theory revision and other theory-guided systems face. First, a representation language appropriate for the initial theory may be inappropriate for an improved theory. While the original representation may concisely express the initial theory, a more accurate theory forced to use that same representation may be bulky, cumbersome, and difficult to reach. Second, a theory structure suitable for a coarse domain theory may be insufficient for a fine-tuned theory. Systems that produce only small, local changes to a theory have limited value for accomplishing complex structural alterations that may be required. Consequently, advanced theory-guided learning systems require flexible representation and flexible structure. An analysis of various theory revision systems and theory-guided learning systems reveals specific strengths and weaknesses in terms of these two desired properties. Designed to capture the underlying qualities of each system, a new system uses theory-guided constructive induction. Experiments in three domains show improvement over previous theory-guided systems. This leads to a study of the behavior, limitations, and potential of theory-guided constructive induction.",

Ernest Rutherford, 1930 Most proponents of cold fusion reporting excess heat from their electrolysis experiments were claiming that one of the main characteristics of cold fusion was its irreproducibility | J.R. Huizenga, Cold Fusion, 1993, p. 78 Abstract Amid the ever increasing research into various aspects of neural computing, much progress is evident both from theoretical advances and from empirical studies. On the empirical side a wealth of data from experimental studies is being reported. It is, however, not clear how best to report neural computing experiments such that they may be replicated by other interested researchers. In particular, the nature of iterative learning on a randomised initial architecture, such as backpropagation training of a multilayer perceptron, is such that precise replication of a reported result is virtually impossible. The outcome is that experimental replication of reported results, a touchstone of \"the scientific method\", is not an option for researchers in this most popular subfield of neural computing. In this paper, we address this issue of replicability of experiments based on backpropagation training of multilayer perceptrons (although many of our results will be applicable to any other subfield that is plagued by the same characteristics). First, we attempt to produce a complete abstract specification of such a neural computing experiment. From this specification we identify the full range of parameters needed to support maximum replicability, and we use it to show why absolute replicability is not an option in practice. We propose a statistical framework to support replicability. We demonstrate this framework with some empirical studies of our own on both repli-cability with respect to experimental controls, and validity of implementations of the backpropagation algorithm. Finally, we suggest how the degree of replicability of a neural computing experiment can be estimated and reflected in the claimed precision for any empirical results reported. ",

The framework makes possible: (1) objective comparisons between solutions using alternative network architectures; (2) objective stopping rules for network pruning or growing procedures; (3) objective choice of magnitude and type of weight decay terms or additive regularisers (for penalising large weights, etc.); (4) a measure of the effective number of well-determined parameters in a model; (5) quantified estimates of the error bars on network parameters and on network output; (6) objective comparisons with alternative learning and interpolation models such as splines and radial basis functions. The Bayesian `evidence' automatically embodies `Occam's razor,' penalising over-flexible and over-complex models. The Bayesian approach helps detect poor underlying assumptions in learning models. For learning models well matched to a problem, a good correlation between generalisation ability and the Bayesian evidence is obtained. This paper makes use of the Bayesian framework for regularisation and model comparison described in the companion paper `Bayesian interpolation' (MacKay, 1991a). This framework is due to Gull and Skilling (Gull, 1989a). ",

In previous work we demonstrated the performance potential of simultaneous multithreading, based on a somewhat idealized model. In this paper we show that the throughput gains from simultaneous multithreading can be achieved without extensive changes to a conventional wide-issue superscalar, either in hardware structures or sizes. We present an architecture for simultaneous multithreading that achieves three goals: (1) it minimizes the architectural impact on the conventional superscalar design, (2) it has minimal performance impact on a single thread executing alone, and (3) it achieves significant throughput gains when running multiple threads. Our simultaneous multithreading architecture achieves a throughput of 5.4 instructions per cycle, a 2.5-fold improvement over an unmodified superscalar with similar hardware resources. This speedup is enhanced by an advantage of multithreading previously unexploited in other architectures: the ability to favor for fetch and issue those threads most efficiently using the processor each cycle, thereby providing the best instructions to the processor.

Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley.  \nAbstract: To implement a specific application, you should only have to change the file app.c. Section 2 describes the routines in app.c in detail. If you use additional variables for your specific problem, the easiest method of making them available to other program units is to declare them in sga.h and external.h. However, take care that you do not redeclare existing variables. Two example applications files are included in the SGA-C distribution. The file app1.c performs the simple example problem included with the Pascal version; finding the maximum of x 10 , where x is an integer interpretation of a chromosome. A slightly more complex application is include in app2.c. This application illustrates two features that have been added to SGA-C. The first of these is the ithruj2int function, which converts bits i through j in a chromosome to an integer. The second new feature is the utility pointer that is associated with each population member. The example application interprets each chromosome as a set of concatenated integers in binary form. The lengths of these integer fields is determined by the user-specified value of field size, which is read in by the function app data(). The field size must be less than the smallest of the chromosome length and the length of an unsigned integer. An integer array for storing the interpreted form of each chromosome is dynamically allocated and assigned to the chromosome's utility pointer in app malloc(). The ithruj2int routine (see utility.c) is used to translate each chromosome into its associated vector. The fitness for each chromosome is simply the sum of the squares of these integers. This example application will function for any chromosome length. SGA-C is intended to be a simple program for first-time GA experimentation. It is not intended to be definitive in terms of its efficiency or the grace of its implementation. The authors are interested in the comments, criticisms, and bug reports from SGA-C users, so that the code can be refined for easier use in subsequent versions.

For these networks, we give efficient algorithms for computing rigorous bounds on the marginal probabilities of evidence at the output layer. Our methods apply generally to the computation of both upper and lower bounds, as well as to generic transfer function parameterizations of the conditional probability tables (such as sigmoid and noisy-OR). We also prove rates of convergence of the accuracy of our bounds as a function of network size. Our results are derived by applying the theory of large deviations to the weighted sums of parents at each node in the network. Bounds on the marginal probabilities are computed from two contributions: one assuming that these weighted sums fall near their mean values, and the other assuming that they do not. This gives rise to an interesting trade-off between probable explanations of the evidence and improbable deviations from the mean. In networks where each child has N parents, the gap between our upper and lower bounds behaves as a sum of two terms, one of order p In addition to providing such rates of convergence for large networks, our methods also yield efficient algorithms for approximate inference in fixed networks.

The value of this theoretical understanding, however, is tempered by many practical concerns. One important question is whether DP-based approaches that use function approximation rather than lookup tables, can avoid catastrophic effects on performance. This note presents a result in Bertsekas (1987) which guarantees that small errors in the approximation of a task's optimal value function cannot produce arbitrarily bad performance when actions are selected greedily. We derive an upper bound on performance loss which is slightly tighter than that in Bertsekas (1987), and we show the extension of the bound to Q-learning (Watkins, 1989).

The objective of integration is to construct one system that exploits all the knowledge that is available and has good performance. The aim of this paper is to discuss the methodology of knowledge integration and present some concrete results. In our experiments the performance of the integrated theory exceeded the performance of the individual theories by quite a significant amount. Also, the performance did not fluctuate much when the experiments were repeated. These results indicate knowledge integration can complement other existing ML methods. ",

According to reductionist theories, listeners judge the structural importance of musical events while forming mental representations. These judgments may result from the production of reduced memory representations that retain only the musical gist. In a study of improvised music performance, pianists produced variations on melodies. Analyses of the musical events retained across variations provided support for the reductionist account of structural importance. A neural network trained to produce reduced memory representations for the same melodies represented structurally important events more efficiently than others. Agreement among the musicians' improvisations, the network model, and music-theoretic predictions suggest that perceived constancy across musical variation is a natural result of a reductionist mechanism for producing memory representations.

In this article we provide a generic adaptation scheme for the above algorithm. The adaptive scheme is to use the knowledge of the stationary distribution gathered so far and then to update during the course of the simulation. This method is easy to implement and often leads to considerable improvement. We obtain theoretical results for the adaptive scheme. Our proposed methodology is illustrated with a number of realistic examples in Bayesian computation and its performance is compared with other available MCMC techniques.

It was implemented prototypically and tested to support the design process in building engineering (Borner and Janetzko 1995, Borner 1995). There are a number of features that distinguish CA from standard approaches to CBR and AR. First of all, CA automatically extracts the knowledge needed to support design tasks (i.e., complex case representations, the relevance of object features and relations, and proper adaptations) from attribute-value representations of prior layouts. Secondly, it effectively determines the similarity of complex case representations in terms of adaptability. Thirdly, implemented and integrated into a highly interactive and adaptive system architecture it allows for incremental knowledge acquisition and user support. This paper surveys the basic assumptions and the psychological results which influenced the development of CA. It sketches the knowledge representation formalisms employed and characterizes the sub-processes needed to integrate memory organization and analogical reasoning. ",

In this paper, we investigate schemes for improving performance in the face of imperfect branch predictors by having the processor simultaneously execute code from both the taken and not-taken outcomes of a branch. This paper presents data regarding the limits of multipath execution, considers fetch-bandwidth needs for multipath execution, and discusses various dynamic confidence-prediction schemes that gauge the likelihood of branch mispredictions. Our evaluations consider executing along several (28) paths at once. Using 4 paths and a relatively simple confidence predictor, multipath execution garners speedups of up to 30% compared to the single-path case, with an average speedup of 14.4% for the SPECint suite. While associated increases in instruction-fetch-bandwidth requirements are not too surprising, a less expected result is the significance of having a separate return-address stack for each forked path. Overall, our results indicate that multipath execution offers significant improvements over single-path performance, and could be especially useful when combined with multithreading so that hardware costs can be amortized over both approaches.

    "text": "Title: Neural net architectures for temporal sequence processing  \nAbstract: I present a general taxonomy of neural net architectures for processing time-varying patterns. This taxonomy subsumes many existing architectures in the literature, and points to several promising architectures that have yet to be examined. Any architecture that processes time-varying patterns requires two conceptually distinct components: a short-term memory that holds on to relevant past events and an associator that uses the short-term memory to classify or predict. My taxonomy is based on a characterization of short-term memory models along the dimensions of form, content, and adaptability. Experiments on predicting future values of a financial time series (US dollar-Swiss franc exchange rates) are presented using several alternative memory models. The results of these experiments serve as a baseline against which more sophisticated architectures can be compared. Neural networks have proven to be a promising alternative to traditional techniques for nonlinear temporal prediction tasks (e.g., Curtiss, Brandemuehl, & Kreider, 1992; Lapedes & Farber, 1987; Weigend, Huberman, & Rumelhart, 1992). However, temporal prediction is a particularly challenging problem because conventional neural net architectures and algorithms are not well suited for patterns that vary over time. The prototypical use of neural nets is in structural pattern recognition. In such a task, a collection of features|visual, semantic, or otherwise|is presented to a network and the network must categorize the input feature pattern as belonging to one or more classes. For example, a network might be trained to classify animal species based on a set of attributes describing living creatures such as \"has tail\", \"lives in water\", or \"is carnivorous\"; or a network could be trained to recognize visual patterns over a two-dimensional pixel array as a letter in fA; B; . . . ; Zg. In such tasks, the network is presented with all relevant information simultaneously. In contrast, temporal pattern recognition involves processing of patterns that evolve over time. The appropriate response at a particular point in time depends not only on the current input, but potentially all previous inputs. This is illustrated in Figure 1, which shows the basic framework for a temporal prediction problem. I assume that time is quantized into discrete steps, a sensible assumption because many time series of interest are intrinsically discrete, and continuous series can be sampled at a fixed interval. The input at time t is denoted x(t). For univariate series, this input ",

    "text": "Title: 17 Massively Parallel Genetic Programming  \nAbstract: As the field of Genetic Programming (GP) matures and its breadth of application increases, the need for parallel implementations becomes absolutely necessary. The transputer-based system presented in the chapter by Koza and Andre ([11]) is one of the rare such parallel implementations. Until today, no implementation has been proposed for parallel GP using a SIMD architecture, except for a data-parallel approach ([20]), although others have exploited workstation farms and pipelined supercomputers. One reason is certainly the apparent difficulty of dealing with the parallel evaluation of different S-expressions when only a single instruction can be executed at the same time on every processor. The aim of this chapter is to present such an implementation of parallel GP on a SIMD system, where each processor can efficiently evaluate a different S-expression. We have implemented this approach on a MasPar MP-2 computer, and will present some timing results. To the extent that SIMD machines, like the MasPar are available to offer cost-effective cycles for scientific experimentation, this is a useful approach. The idea of simulating a MIMD machine using a SIMD architecture is not new ([8, 15]). One of the original ideas for the Connection Machine ([8]) was that it could simulate other parallel architectures. Indeed, in the extreme, each processor on a SIMD architecture can simulate a universal Turing machine (TM). With different turing machine specifications stored in each local memory, each processor would simply have its own tape, tape head, state table and state pointer, and the simulation would be performed by repeating the basic TM operations simultaneously. Of course, such a simulation would be very inefficient, and difficult to program, but would have the advantage of being really MIMD, where no SIMD processor would be in idle state, until its simulated machine halts. Now let us consider an alternative idea, that each SIMD processor would simulate an individual stored program computer using a simple instruction set. For each step of the simulation, the SIMD system would sequentially execute each possible instruction on the subset of processors whose next instruction match it. For a typical assembly language, even with a reduced instruction set, most processors would be idle most of the time. However, if the set of instructions implemented on the virtual processor is very small, this approach can be fruitful. In the case of Genetic Programming, the \"instruction set\" is composed of the specified set of functions designed for the task. We will show below that with a precompilation step, simply adding a push, a conditional, and unconditional branching and a stop instruction, we can get a very effective MIMD simulation running. This chapter reports such an implementation of GP on a MasPar MP-2 parallel computer. The configuration of our system is composed of 4K processor elements ",

Non-linear regression using `neural networks' is a popular technique for such modeling tasks. Since it is not obvious how large a time-window of inputs is appropriate, or what preprocessing of inputs is best, this can be viewed as a regression problem in which there are many possible input variables, some of which may actually be irrelevant to the prediction of the output variable. Because a finite data set will show random correlations between the irrelevant inputs and the output, any conventional neural network (even with reg-ularisation or `weight decay') will not set the coefficients for these junk inputs to zero. Thus the irrelevant variables will hurt the model's performance. The Automatic Relevance Determination (ARD) model puts a prior over the regression parameters which embodies the concept of relevance. This is done in a simple and `soft' way by introducing multiple regularisation constants, one associated with each input. Using Bayesian methods, the regularisation constants for junk inputs are automatically inferred to be large, preventing those inputs from causing significant overfitting. ",

    "text": "Title: on Inductive Logic Programming (ILP-95) Inducing Logic Programs without Explicit Negative Examples  \nAbstract: Instance-based learning methods explicitly remember all the data that they receive. They usually have no training phase, and only at prediction time do they perform computation. Then, they take a query, search the database for similar datapoints and build an on-line local model (such as a local average or local regression) with which to predict an output value. In this paper we review the advantages of instance based methods for autonomous systems, but we also note the ensuing cost: hopelessly slow computation as the database grows large. We present and evaluate a new way of structuring a database and a new algorithm for accessing it that maintains the advantages of instance-based learning. Earlier attempts to combat the cost of instance-based learning have sacrificed the explicit retention of all data, or been applicable only to instance-based predictions based on a small number of near neighbors or have had to re-introduce an explicit training phase in the form of an interpolative data structure. Our approach builds a multiresolution data structure to summarize the database of experiences at all resolutions of interest simultaneously. This permits us to query the database with the same exibility as a conventional linear search, but at greatly reduced computational cost.",

Abstract A technique is described which allows unimodal function optimization methods to be extended to efficiently locate all optima of multimodal problems. We describe an algorithm based on a traditional genetic algorithm (GA). This involves iterating the GA, but uses knowledge gained during one iteration to avoid re-searching, on subsequent iterations, regions of problem space where solutions have already been found. This is achieved by applying a fitness derating function to the raw fitness function, so that fitness values are depressed in the regions of the problem space where solutions have already been found. Consequently, the likelihood of discovering a new solution on each iteration is dramatically increased. The technique may be used with various styles of GA, or with other optimization methods, such as simulated annealing. The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated on a number of multimodal test functions. The technique is at least as fast as fitness sharing methods. It provides a speedup of between 1 and 10p on a problem with p optima, depending on the value of p and the convergence time complexity. ",

The question we address in this paper is whether there is an analogous algorithm that can be used in large stochastic state spaces requiring function approximation. We present such an algorithm, analyze it, and give comparative results to TD on several domains. the state).

Then, it runs through that list in reverse, performing one backup per state.

However, as transformations that improve performance on one set of problems can degrade performance on other sets, the new PE 0 is not always better than the original PE; this depends on the distribution of problems. We therefore seek the performance element whose expected performance, over this distribution, is optimal. Unfortunately, the actual distribution, which is needed to determine which element is optimal, is usually not known. Moreover, the task of finding the optimal element, even knowing the distribution, is intractable for most interesting spaces of elements. This paper presents a method, palo, that side-steps these problems by using a set of samples to estimate the unknown distribution, and by using a set of transformations to hill-climb to a local optimum. This process is based on a mathematically rigorous form of utility analysis: in particular, it uses statistical techniques to determine whether the result of a proposed transformation will be better than the original system.

Skills acquired while performing elemental tasks are also applied to solve composite tasks. Individual skills compete for the right to act and only winning skills are included in the decomposition of the composite task. We extend the original CQ-L concept in two ways: (1) a more general reward function, and (2) the agent can have more than one actuator. We use the CQ-L architecture to acquire skills for performing composite tasks with a simulated two-linked manipulator having large state and action spaces. The manipulator is a non-linear dynamical system and we require its end-effector to be at specific positions in the workspace. Fast function approximation in each of the Q-modules is achieved through the use of an array of Cerebellar Model Articulation Controller (CMAC) (Albus Our research interests involve the scaling up of machine learning methods, especially reinforcement learning, for autonomous robot control. We are interested in function approximators suitable for reinforcement learning in problems with large state spaces, such as the Cerebellar Model Articulation Controller (CMAC) (Albus 1975) which permit fast, online learning and good local generalization. In addition, we are interested in task decomposition by reinforcement learning and the use of hierarchical and modular function approximator architectures. We are examining the effectiveness of a modified Hierarchical Mixtures of Experts (HME) (Jordan & Jacobs 1993) approach for reinforcement learning since the original HME was developed mainly for supervised learning and batch learning tasks. The incorporation of domain knowledge into reinforcement learning agents is an important way of extending their capabilities. Default policies can be specified, and domain knowledge can also be used to restrict the size of the state-action space, leading to faster learning. We are investigating the use of Q-Learning (Watkins 1989) in planning tasks, using a classifier system (Holland 1986) to encode the necessary condition-action rules. Jordan, M. & Jacobs, R.

In semi-flexible prediction, learning should improve prediction of a specific set of features known a priori rather than a single known feature (as in classification) or an arbitrary set of features (as in conceptual clustering). We describe one such task from natural language processing and present experiments that compare solutions to the problem using decision trees, CBL, and a hybrid approach that combines the two. In the hybrid approach, decision trees are used to specify the features to be included in k-nearest neighbor case retrieval. Results from the experiments show that the hybrid approach outperforms both the decision tree and case-based approaches as well as two case-based systems that incorporate expert knowledge into their case retrieval algorithms.

The model extends and unifies the models used in (Pazzani et al., 1994) and (Masand & Piatetsky-Shapiro, 1996). It attempts to answer the question \"Should a given machine learning system now in the prototype stage be fielded?\" The model's inputs are the system's confusion matrix, the cash flow matrix for the application, the cost per decision, the one-time cost of deploying the system, and the rate of return on investment. Like Provost and Fawcett's (1997) ROC convex hull method, the present model can be used for decision-making even when its input variables are not known exactly. Despite its simplicity, it has a number of non-trivial consequences. For example, under it the \"no free lunch\" theorems of learning theory no longer apply. ",

In order to prove our main results, we define a new complexity measure on statistical query (SQ) learning algorithms. The view of an SQ algorithm is the maximum over all queries in the algorithm, of the number of input bits on which the query depends. We show that a restricted view SQ algorithm for a class is a general sufficient condition for learnability in both the models of attribute noise and covered (or missing) attributes. We further show that since the algorithms in question are statistical, they can also simultaneously tolerate classification noise. Classes for which these results hold, and can therefore be learned with simultaneous attribute noise and classification noise, include k-DNF, k-term-DNF by DNF representations, conjunctions with few relevant variables, and over the uniform distribution, decision lists. These noise models are the first PAC models in which all training data, attributes and labels, may be corrupted by a random process. Previous researchers had shown that the class of k-DNF is learnable with attribute noise if the attribute noise rate is known exactly. We show that all of our attribute noise learnabil-ity results, either with or without classification noise, also hold when the exact noise rate is not Appeared in Proceedings of the Eighth Annual ACM Conference on Computational Learning Theory.

In addition, we show that the results also hold when there is not one single noise rate, but a distinct noise rate for each attribute. Our results for learning with random covering do not require the learner to be told even an approximation of the covering rate and in addition hold in the setting with distinct covering rates for each attribute. Finally, we give lower bounds on the number of examples required for learning in the presence of attribute noise or covering.",

Separate HMM modules were designed and trained for specific regions of DNA: exons, introns, intergenic regions, and splice sites. The models were then tied together to form a biologically feasible topology. The integrated HMM was trained further on a set of eukaryotic DNA sequences, and tested by using it to segment a separate set of sequences. The resulting HMM system, which is called VEIL (Viterbi Exon-Intron Locator), obtains an overall accuracy on test data of 92% of total bases correctly labelled, with a correlation coefficient of 0.73. Using the more stringent test of exact exon prediction, VEIL correctly located both ends of 53% of the coding exons, and 49% of the exons it predicts are exactly correct. These results compare favorably to the best previous results for gene structure prediction, and demonstrate the benefits of using HMMs for this problem.",

Belief revision is intended to capture changes of an agent's belief state reflecting new information about a static world. Belief update is intended to capture changes of belief in response to a changing world. We argue that both belief revision and belief update are too restrictive; routine belief change involves elements of both. We present a model for generalized update that allows updates in response to external changes to inform the agent about its prior beliefs. This model of update combines aspects of revision and update, providing a more realistic characterization of belief change. We show that, under certain assumptions, the original update postulates are satisfied. We also demonstrate that plain revision and plain update are special cases of our model, in a way that formally verifies the intuition that revision is suitable for static belief change.",

In recent years, two special cases of belief change, belief revision and belief update, have been studied in detail. Roughly speaking, revision treats a surprising observation as a sign that previous beliefs were wrong, while update treats a surprising observation as an indication that the world has changed. In general, we would expect that an agent making an observation may both want to revise some earlier beliefs and assume that some change has occurred in the world. We define a novel approach to belief change that allows us to do this, by applying ideas from probability theory in a qualitative settings. The key idea is to use a qualitative Markov assumption, which says that state transitions are independent. We show that a recent approach to modeling qualitative uncertainty using plausibility measures allows us to make such a qualitative Markov assumption in a relatively straightforward way, and show how the Markov assumption can be used to provide an attractive belief-change model.",

Like logic, the formalism admits qualitative sentences and provides symbolic machinery for deriving deductively closed beliefs and, like probability, it permits us to express if-then rules with different levels of firmness and to retract beliefs in response to changing observations. Rules are interpreted as order-of-magnitude approximations of conditional probabilities which impose constraints over the rankings of worlds. Inferences are supported by a unique priority ordering on rules which is syntactically derived from the knowledge base. This ordering accounts for rule interactions, respects specificity considerations and facilitates the construction of coherent states of beliefs. Practical algorithms are developed and analyzed for testing consistency, computing rule ordering, and answering queries. Imprecise observations are incorporated using qualitative versions of Jef-frey's Rule and Bayesian updating, with the result that coherent belief revision is embodied naturally and tractably. Finally, causal rules are interpreted as imposing Markovian conditions that further constrain world rankings to reflect the modularity of causal organizations. These constraints are shown to facilitate reasoning about causal projections, explanations, actions and change. ",

    "text": "Title: 20 Data Structures and Genetic Programming  two techniques for reducing run time.  \nAbstract: In real world applications, software engineers recognise the use of memory must be organised via data structures and that software using the data must be independant of the data structures' implementation details. They achieve this by using abstract data structures, such as records, files and buffers. We demonstrate that genetic programming can automatically implement simple abstract data structures, considering in detail the task of evolving a list. We show general and reasonably efficient implementations can be automatically generated from simple primitives. A model for maintaining evolved code is demonstrated using the list problem. Much published work on genetic programming (GP) evolves functions without side-effects to learn patterns in test data. In contrast human written programs often make extensive and explicit use of memory. Indeed memory in some form is required for a programming system to be Turing Complete, i.e. for it to be possible to write any (computable) program in that system. However inclusion of memory can make the interactions between parts of programs much more complex and so make it harder to produce programs. Despite this it has been shown GP can automatically create programs which explicitly use memory [Teller 1994]. In both normal and genetic programming considerable benefits have been found in adopting a structured approach. For example [Koza 1994] shows the introduction of evolvable code modules (automatically defined functions, ADFs) can greatly help GP to reach a solution. We suggest that a corresponding structured approach to use of data will similarly have significant advantage to GP. Earlier work has demonstrated that genetic programming can automatically generate simple abstract data structures, namely stacks and queues [Langdon 1995a]. That is, GP can evolve programs that organise memory (accessed via simple read and write primitives) into data structures which can be used by external software without it needing to know how they are implemented. This chapter shows it is possible to evolve a list data structure from basic primitives. [Aho, Hopcroft and Ullman 1987] suggest three different ways to implement a list but these experiments show GP can evolve its own implementation. This requires all the list components to agree on one implementation as they co-evolve together. Section 20.3 describes the GP architecture, including use of Pareto multiple component fitness scoring (20.3.4) and measures aimed at speeding the GP search (20.3.5). The evolved solutions are described in Section 20.4. Section 20.5 presents a candidate model for maintaining evolved software. This is followed by a discussion of what we have learned (20.6) and conclusions that can be drawn (20.7). ",

In this paper, we introduce performance metrics to compare confidence estimation mechanisms, and argue that these metrics are appropriate for speculation control. We compare a number of confidence estimation mechanisms, focusing on mechanisms that have a small implementation cost and gain benefit by exploiting characteristics of branch predictors, such as clustering of mispredicted branches. We compare the performance of the different confidence estimation methods using detailed pipeline simulations. Using these simulations, we show how to improve some confidence estimators, providing better insight for future investigations comparing and applying confidence estimators. ",

We compare the performance of the exact BM learning algorithm with first order (Weiss) mean field theory and second order (TAP) mean field theory. The learning task consists of a fully connected Ising spin glass model on 10 neurons. We conclude that 1) the method works well for paramagnetic problems 2) the TAP correction gives a significant improvement over the Weiss mean field theory, both for paramagnetic and spin glass problems and 3) that the inclusion of diagonal weights improves the Weiss approximation for paramagnetic problems, but not for spin glass problems.",

The approach can be applied in cases where several similar instances of a combinatorial optimization problem must be solved. The key idea is to analyze a set of \"training\" problem instances and learn a search control policy for solving new problem instances. The search control policy has the twin goals of finding high-quality solutions and finding them quickly. Results of applying this methodology to a NASA scheduling problem show that the learned search control policy is much more effective than the best known non-learning search procedure|a method based on simulated annealing.",

    "text": "Title: Learning Curve Bounds for Markov Decision Processes with Undiscounted Rewards  \nAbstract: Markov decision processes (MDPs) with undis-counted rewards represent an important class of problems in decision and control. The goal of learning in these MDPs is to find a policy that yields the maximum expected return per unit time. In large state spaces, computing these averages directly is not feasible; instead, the agent must estimate them by stochastic exploration of the state space. In this case, longer exploration times enable more accurate estimates and more informed decision-making. The learning curve for an MDP measures how the agent's performance depends on the allowed exploration time, T . In this paper we analyze these learning curves for a simple control problem with undiscounted rewards. In particular, methods from statistical mechanics are used to calculate lower bounds on the agent's performance in the thermodynamic limit T ! 1, N ! 1, ff = T =N (finite), where T is the number of time steps allotted per policy evaluation and N is the size of the state space. In this limit, we provide a lower bound on the return of policies that appear optimal based on imperfect statistics.",

In this paper we summarize an approach to this problem based on the mathematical framework of Markov decision processes and reinforcement learning. Conventional model-based reinforcement learning uses primitive actions that last one time step and that can be modeled independently of the learning agent. These can be generalized to macro actions, multi-step actions specified by an arbitrary policy and a way of completing. Macro actions generalize the classical notion of a macro operator in that they are closed loop, uncertain, and of variable duration. Macro actions are needed to represent common-sense higher-level actions such as going to lunch, grasping an object, or traveling to a distant city. This paper generalizes prior work on temporally abstract models (Sutton 1995) and extends it from the prediction setting to include actions, control, and planning. We define a semantics of models of macro actions that guarantees the validity of planning using such models. This paper present new results in the theory of planning with macro actions and illustrates its potential advantages in a gridworld task. ",

These tests are compared experimentally to determine their probability of incorrectly detecting a difference when no difference exists (type 1 error). Two widely-used statistical tests are shown to have high probability of Type I error in certain situations and should never be used. These tests are (a) a test for the difference of two proportions and (b) a paired-differences t test based on taking several random train/test splits. A third test, a paired-differences t test based on 10-fold cross-validation, exhibits somewhat elevated probability of Type I error. A fourth test, McNemar's test, is shown to have low Type I error. The fifth test is a new test, 5x2cv, based on 5 iterations of 2-fold cross-validation. Experiments show that this test also has good Type I error. The paper also measures the power (ability to detect algorithm differences when they do exist) of these tests. The 5x2cv test is shown to be slightly more powerful than McNemar's test. The choice of the best test is determined by the computational cost of running the learning algorithm. For algorithms that can be executed only once, McNemar's test is the only test with acceptable Type I error. For algorithms that can be executed ten times, the 5x2cv test is recommended, because it is slightly more powerful and because it directly measures variation due to the choice of training set. ",

Nonetheless, this approach provides new opportunities for parallel processing and, in the case of sequential processing, a tradeoff of time for memory. We also show how a hybrid method (Suermondt and others 1990) combining loop-cutset conditioning with Jensen's method can be viewed within our framework.

These invariances can be achieved by enhancing the training data to include examples of inputs transformed by elements of G, while leaving the corresponding targets unchanged. Alternatively the cost function for training can include a regularization term that penalizes changes in the output when the input is transformed under the group. This paper relates the two approaches, showing precisely the sense in which the regularized cost function approximates the result of adding transformed (or distorted) examples to the training data. The cost function for the enhanced training set is equivalent to the sum of the original cost function plus a regularizer. For unbiased models, the regularizer reduces to the intuitively obvious choice - a term that penalizes changes in the output when the inputs are transformed under the group. For infinitesimal transformations, the coefficient of the regularization term reduces to the variance of the distortions introduced into the training data. This correspondence provides a simple bridge between the two approaches. ",

We present a notion of causal independence that enables one to further factorize the conditional probabilities into a combination of even smaller factors and consequently obtain a finer-grain factorization of the joint probability. The new formulation of causal independence lets us specify the conditional probability of a variable given its parents in terms of an associative and commutative operator, such as or, sum or max, on the contribution of each parent. We start with a simple algorithm VE for Bayesian network inference that, given evidence and a query variable, uses the factorization to find the posterior distribution of the query. We show how this algorithm can be extended to exploit causal independence.

Our model will generate explanations that nonmonotonically predict an observation, thus generalizing most current accounts, which require some deductive relationship between explanation and observation. It also provides a natural preference ordering on explanations, defined in terms of normality or plausibility. To illustrate the generality of our approach, we reconstruct two of the key paradigms for model-based diagnosis, abductive and consistency-based diagnosis, within our framework. This reconstruction provides an alternative semantics for both and extends these systems to accommodate our predictive explanations and semantic preferences on explanations.

    "text": "Title: First Order Regression: Applications in Real-World Domains  \nAbstract: A first order regression algorithm capable of handling real-valued (continuous) variables is introduced and some of its applications are presented. Regressional learning assumes real-valued class and discrete or real-valued variables. The algorithm combines regressional learning with standard ILP concepts, such as first order concept description and background knowledge. A clause is generated by successively refining the initial clause by adding literals of the form A = v for the discrete attributes, A v and A v for the real-valued attributes, and background knowledge literals to the clause body. The algorithm employs a covering approach (beam search), a heuristic impurity function, and stopping criteria based on local improvement, minimum number of examples, maximum clause length, minimum local improvement, minimum description length, allowed error, and variable depth. An outline of the algorithm and the results of the system's application in some artificial and real-world domains are presented.

    "text": "Title: Induction of Multiscale Temporal Structure  \nAbstract: Learning structure in temporally-extended sequences is a difficult computational problem because only a fraction of the relevant information is available at any instant. Although variants of back propagation can in principle be used to find structure in sequences, in practice they are not sufficiently powerful to discover arbitrary contingencies, especially those spanning long temporal intervals or involving high order statistics. For example, in designing a connectionist network for music composition, we have encountered the problem that the net is able to learn musical structure that occurs locally in time|e.g., relations among notes within a musical phrase|but not structure that occurs over longer time periods|e.g., relations among phrases. To address this problem, we require a means of constructing a reduced description of the sequence that makes global aspects more explicit or more readily detectable. I propose to achieve this using hidden units that operate with different time constants. Simulation experiments indicate that slower time-scale hidden units are able to pick up global structure, structure that simply can not be learned by standard Many patterns in the world are intrinsically temporal, e.g., speech, music, the unfolding of events. Recurrent neural net architectures have been devised to accommodate time-varying sequences. For example, the architecture shown in Figure 1 can map a sequence of inputs to a sequence of outputs. Learning structure in temporally-extended sequences is a difficult computational problem because the input pattern may not contain all the task-relevant information at any instant. Thus, back propagation.",

Judd, and S. Hanson, (eds.), forthcoming 1995.

A number of factors, including training-set size and the ability of the learning algorithm to perform constructive induction, can mediate the effect of an input representation on the accuracy of a learned concept description. We present experiments that evaluate the effect of input representation on generalization performance for the real-world problem of finding genes in DNA. Our experiments that demonstrate that: (1) two different input representations for this task result in significantly different generalization performance for both neural networks and decision trees; and (2) both neural and symbolic methods for constructive induction fail to bridge the gap between these two representations. We believe that this real-world domain provides an interesting challenge problem for the machine learning subfield of constructive induction because the relationship between the two representations is well known, and because conceptually, the representational shift involved in constructing the better representation should not be too imposing.

Topology-preserving maps, on the other hand, can be developed by a variant of the competitive learning procedure. However, in a degenerate case, self-supervised backpropagation is a version of competitive learning. A simple extension of the cost function of backpropagation leads to a competitive version of self-supervised backpropagation, which can be used to produce topographic maps.

Attention here is restricted to functions whose Fourier transform is smooth on IR d n0, and has a singularity at the origin. Examples of such basis functions are the thin-plate splines and the multiquadrics, as well as other types of radial basis functions that are employed in Approximation Theory. The above approximation problem is well-understood in case the set of points ffi used for translating forms a lattice in IR d , and many optimal and quasi-optimal approximation schemes can already be found in the literature. In contrast, only few, mostly specific, results are known for a set ffi of scattered points. The main objective of this paper is to provide a general tool for extending approximation schemes that use integer translates of a basis function to the non-uniform case. We introduce a single, relatively simple, conversion method that preserves the approximation orders provided by a large number of schemes presently in the literature (more precisely, to almost all \"stationary schemes\"). In anticipation of future introduction of new schemes for uniform grids, an effort is made to impose only a few mild conditions on the function , which still allow for a unified error analysis to hold.

This paper shows that both methods involve fundamentally the same process of propagating information backward from the goal toward the starting state. Most RL methods perform this propagation on a state-by-state basis, while EBL methods compute the weakest preconditions of operators, and hence, perform this propagation on a region-by-region basis. Barto, Bradtke, and Singh (1995) have observed that many algorithms for reinforcement learning can be viewed as asynchronous dynamic programming. Based on this observation, this paper shows how to develop dynamic programming versions of EBL, which we call region-based dynamic programming or Explanation-Based Reinforcement Learning (EBRL). The paper compares batch and online versions of EBRL to batch and online versions of point-based dynamic programming and to standard EBL. The results show that region-based dynamic programming combines the strengths of EBL (fast learning and the ability to scale to large state spaces) with the strengths of reinforcement learning algorithms (learning of optimal policies). Results are shown in chess endgames and in synthetic maze tasks. ",

It is shown that by introducing state variables that correspond to certain statistics of the dynamic behavior of the algorithm, it is possible to find the representative centers of the lower dimensional manifolds that define the boundaries between classes, for clouds of multi-dimensional, multi-class data; this permits one, for example, to find class boundaries directly from sparse data (e.g., in image segmentation tasks) or to efficiently place centers for pattern classification (e.g., with local Gaussian classifiers). The same state variables can be used to define algorithms for determining adaptively the optimal number of centers for clouds of data with space-varying density.

In some cases, exploration might have unsafe, or even catastrophic, results, often modeled in terms of reaching `failure' states of the agent's environment. This paper presents a method that uses domain knowledge to reduce the number of failures during exploration. This method formulates the set of actions from which the RL agent composes a control policy to ensure that exploration is conducted in a policy space that excludes most of the unacceptable policies. The resulting action set has a more abstract relationship to the task being solved than is common in many applications of RL. Although the cost of this added safety is that learning may result in a suboptimal solution, we argue that this is an appropriate tradeoff in many problems. We illustrate this method in the domain of motion planning. ",

Inductive algorithms such as AQ and CN2 learn decision lists incrementally, one rule at a time. Such algorithms face the rule overlap problem | the classification accuracy of the decision list depends on the overlap between the learned rules. Thus, even though the rules are learned in isolation, they can only be evaluated in concert. Existing algorithms solve this problem by adopting a greedy, iterative structure. Once a rule is learned, the training examples that match the rule are removed from the training set. We propose a novel solution to the problem: composing decision lists from homogeneous rules, rules whose classification accuracy does not change with their position in the decision list. We prove that the problem of finding a maximally accurate decision list can be reduced to the problem of finding maximally accurate homogeneous rules.

The paper presents exact inference algorithms and analyzes the circumstances where exact inference becomes intractable. Two classes of algorithms for numeric approximations are developed through transformations on the original model. The first transformation reduces the robust inference problem to the estimation of probabilistic parameters in a Bayesian network. The second transformation uses Lavine's bracketing algorithm to generate a sequence of maximization problems in a Bayesian network.

Under the deterministic definition, causal irrelevance complies with all of the axioms of path interception in cyclic graphs, with the exception of transitivity.

The first problem arises because no practical neural network can process all the visual input simultaneously and efficiently. The solution is to process a small amount of the input in parallel, and successively focus on the other parts of the input. This strategy requires that the system maintains structured knowledge for describing and interpreting the gathered information. The system should also learn to represent structured knowledge from examples of objects and scenes. VISOR, the system described in this paper, consists of three main components. The Low-Level Visual Module (simulated using procedural programs) extracts featural and positional information from the visual input. The Schema Module encodes structured knowledge about possible objects, and provides top-down information for the Low-Level Visual Module to focus attention at different parts of the scene. The Response Module learns to associate the schema activation patterns with external responses. It enables the external environment to provide reinforcement feedback for the learning of schematic structures. ",

We analyze the assumptions made as one moves along this spectrum and show the tradeoffs between model accuracy and learning speed which become critical to consider in a variety of data mining domains. We then present a general induction algorithm that allows for traversal of this spectrum depending on the available computational power for carrying out induction and show its application in a number of domains with different properties.

Thus there is a change in the level of learning in the population over evolutionary time. This paper explores the idea that as well as the benefits to be gained from learning, there may also be costs to be paid for the ability to learn. It is these costs that supply the selection pressure for the genetic assimilation of acquired traits. Two models are presented that attempt to illustrate this assertion. The first uses Kauffman's NK fitness landscapes to show the effect that both explicit and implicit costs have on the assimilation of learnt traits. A characteristic `hump' is observed in the graph of the level of plasticity in the population showing that learning is first selected for and then against as evolution progresses. The second model is a practical example in which neural network controllers are evolved for a small mobile robot. Results from this experiment also show the hump. ",

This phenomenon, known as the Baldwin Effect, can speed the evolutionary process as traits that are initially acquired become genetically specified in later generations. This paper presents conditions under which this genetic assimilation can take place. As well as the benefits that lifetime adaptation can give a population, there may be a cost to be paid for that adaptive ability. It is the evolutionary trade-off between these costs and benefits that provides the selection pressure for acquired traits to become genetically specified. It is also noted that genotypic space, in which evolution operates, and phenotypic space, on which adaptive processes (such as learning) operate, are, in general, of a different nature. To guarantee an acquired characteristic can become genetically specified, then these spaces must have the property of neighbourhood correlation which means that a small distance between two individuals in phenotypic space implies that there is a small distance between the same two individuals in genotypic space.",

This deteriorating performance can be attributed to the instability of the internal representation of the learned DFA states. The use of a sigmoidal discriminant function together with the recurrent structure contribute to this instability. We prove that a simple algorithm can construct second-order recurrent neural networks with a sparse interconnection topology and sigmoidal discriminant function such that the internal DFA state representations are stable, i.e. the constructed network correctly classifies strings of arbitrary length. The algorithm is based on encoding strengths of weights directly into the neural network. We derive a relationship between the weight strength and the number of DFA states for robust string classification. For a DFA with n states and m input alphabet symbols, the constructive algorithm generates a \"programmed\" neural network with O(n) neurons and O(mn) weights. We compare our algorithm to other methods proposed in the literature. ",

Most research in explanation-based learning involves relaxing constraints on the variables in the explanation of a specific example, rather than generalizing the graphical structure of the explanation itself. However, this precludes the acquisition of concepts where an iterative or recursive process is implicitly represented in the explanation by a fixed number of applications. This paper presents an algorithm that generalizes explanation structures and reports empirical results that demonstrate the value of acquiring recursive and iterative concepts. The BAGGER2 algorithm learns recursive and iterative concepts, integrates results from multiple examples, and extracts useful subconcepts during generalization. On problems where learning a recursive rule is not appropriate, the system produces the same result as standard explanation-based methods. Applying the learned recursive rules only requires a minor extension to a PROLOG-like problem solver, namely, the ability to explicitly call a specific rule. Empirical studies demonstrate that generalizing the structure of explanations helps avoid the recently reported negative effects of learning. ",

We describe the theoretical foundations and practical aspects of learning local structures and provide an empirical evaluation of the proposed learning procedure. This evaluation indicates that learning curves characterizing this procedure converge faster, in the number of training instances, than those of the standard procedure, which ignores the local structure of the CPDs.

The ability to execute down both paths of a conditional branch enables the branch penalty to be minimized; however, relying exclusively on dual path execution is infeasible due because instruction fetch rates far exceed the capability of the pipeline to retire a single branch before others must be processed. By using confidence information, available in the dynamic branch prediction state tables, a limited form of dual path execution becomes feasible. This reduces the burden on the branch predictor by allowing predictions of low confidence to be avoided. In this study we present a new approach to gather branch prediction confidence with little or no overhead, and use this confidence mechanism to determine whether dual path execution or branch prediction should be used. Comparing this hybrid predictor model to the dynamic branch predictor shows a dramatic decrease in misprediction rate, which translates to an reduction in runtime of over 20%. These results imply that dual path execution, which often is thought to be an excessively resource consuming method, may be a worthy approach if restricted with an appropriate predicting set. ",

However, EBL is severely hampered by the requirement of a complete and correct domain theory for successful learning to occur. Clearly, in non-trivial domains, developing such a domain theory is a nearly impossible task. Therefore, much research has been devoted to understanding how an imperfect domain theory can be corrected and extended during system performance. In this paper, we present a characterization of this problem, and use it to analyze past research in the area. Past characterizations of the problem (e.g, [Mitchell et al., 1986; Rajamoney and DeJong, 1987]) have viewed the types of performance errors caused by a faulty domain theory as primary. In contrast, we focus primarily on the types of knowledge deficiencies present in the theory, and from these derive the types of performance errors that can result. Correcting the theory can be viewed as a search through the space of possible domain theories, with a variety of knowledge sources that can be used to guide the search. We examine the types of knowledge used by a variety of past systems for this purpose. The hope is that this analysis will indicate the need for a \"universal weak method\" of domain theory correction, in which different sources of knowledge for theory correction can be freely and flexibly combined.

Routing of messages in such networks presents a real-time instance of a multi-criterion optimization problem in a dynamic and uncertain environment. This paper describes a framework for heuristic routing in large networks. The effectiveness of the heuristic routing mechanism upon which Quo Vadis is based is described as part of a simulation study within a network with grid topology. A formal analysis of the underlying principles is presented through the incremental design of a set of heuristic decision functions that can be used to guide messages along a near-optimal (e.g., minimum delay) path in a large network. This paper carefully derives the properties of such heuristics under a set of simplifying assumptions about the network topology and load dynamics and identify the conditions under which they are guaranteed to route messages along an optimal path. The paper concludes with a discussion of the relevance of the theoretical results presented in the paper to the design of intelligent autonomous adaptive communication networks and an outline of some directions of future research.",

Our analysis is for worst-case situations, i.e., we make no assumptions about the way the sequence of bits to be predicted is generated. We measure the performance of the algorithm by the difference between the expected number of mistakes it makes on the bit sequence and the expected number of mistakes made by the best expert on this sequence, where the expectation is taken with respect to the randomization in the predictions. We show that the minimum achievable difference is on the order of the square root of the number of mistakes of the best expert, and we give efficient algorithms that achieve this. Our upper and lower bounds have matching leading constants in most cases. We give implications of this result on the performance of batch learning algorithms in a PAC setting which improve on the best results currently known in this context. We also extend our analysis to the case in which log loss is used instead of the expected number of mistakes. ",

The approach has been informally presented, exemplified, and implemented for the domain of industrial building design (Borner 1993). By relating the approach to existing theories we provide the foundation of its systematic evaluation and appropriate usage. Cases, the primary repository of knowledge, are represented structurally using an algebraic approach. Similarity relations provide structure preserving case modifications modulo the underlying algebra and an equational theory over the algebra (so available). This representation of a modeled universe of discourse enables theory-based inference of adapted solutions. The approach enables us to incorporate formally generalization, abstraction, geometrical transformation, and their combinations into Cbr. ",

The improvement is achieved by combining a large number of hypotheses, each of which is generated by training the given learning algorithm on a different set of examples. Our algorithm is based on ideas presented by Schapire in his paper \"The strength of weak learnability\", and represents an improvement over his results. The analysis of our algorithm provides general upper bounds on the resources required for learning in Valiant's polynomial PAC learning framework, which are the best general upper bounds known today. We show that the number of hypotheses that are combined by our algorithm is the smallest number possible. Other outcomes of our analysis are results regarding the representational power of threshold circuits, the relation between learnability and compression, and a method for parallelizing PAC learning algorithms. We provide extensions of our algorithms to cases in which the concepts are not binary and to the case where the accuracy of the learning algorithm depends on the distribution of the instances. ",

Each agent is provided a common set of skills (motor schema-based behavioral assemblages) from which it builds a task-achieving strategy using reinforcement learning. The agents learn individually to activate particular behavioral assemblages given their current situation and a reward signal. The experiments, conducted in robot soccer simulations, evaluate the agents in terms of performance, policy convergence, and behavioral diversity. The results show that in many cases, robots will automatically diversify by choosing heterogeneous behaviors. The degree of diversification and the performance of the team depend on the reward structure. When the entire team is jointly rewarded or penalized (global reinforcement), teams tend towards heterogeneous behavior. When agents are provided feedback individually (local reinforcement), they converge to identical policies. ",

We compare an existing indirect method, which uses a conventional dynamic programming algorithm, with a closely related direct reinforcement learning method by applying both methods to an infinite horizon Markov decision problem with unknown state-transition probabilities. The simulations show that although the direct method requires much less space and dramatically less computation per control action, its learning ability in this task is superior to, or compares favorably with, that of the more complex indirect method. Although these results do not address how the methods' performances compare as problems become more difficult, they suggest that given a fixed amount of computational power available per control action, it may be better to use a direct reinforcement learning method augmented with indirect techniques than to devote all available resources to a computation-ally costly indirect method. Comprehensive answers to the questions raised by this study depend on many factors making up the eco nomic context of the computation.",

We begin by defining belief in terms of knowledge and plausibility: an agent believes ' if he knows that ' is true in all the worlds he considers most plausible. We then consider some properties defining the interaction between knowledge and plausibility, and show how these properties affect the properties of belief. In particular, we show that by assuming two of the most natural properties, belief becomes a KD45 operator. Finally, we add time to the picture. This gives us a framework in which we can talk about knowledge, plausibility (and hence belief), and time, which extends the framework of Halpern and Fagin [HF89] for modeling knowledge in multi-agent systems. We show that our framework is quite expressive and lets us model in a natural way a number of different scenarios for belief change. For example, we show how we can capture an analogue to prior probabilities, which can be updated by \"conditioning\". In a related paper, we show how the two best studied scenarios, belief revision and belief update, fit into the framework. ",

This can sometimes be achieved only by careful design of the transition kernel of the chain, on the basis of a detailed preliminary exploratory analysis of . An alternative approach might be to allow the transition kernel to adapt whenever new features of are encountered during the MCMC run. However, if such adaptation occurs infinitely often, the stationary distribution of the chain may be disturbed.

Typically, the regularizer has a single regularization constant ff, and the noise model has a single parameter fi. The ratio ff=fi alone is responsible for determining globally all these attributes of the interpolant: its `complexity', `flexibility', `smoothness', `characteristic scale length', and `characteristic amplitude'. We suggest that interpolation models should be able to capture more than just one flavour of simplicity and complexity. We describe Bayesian models in which the interpolant has a smoothness that varies spatially. We emphasize the importance, in practical implementation, of the concept of `conditional convexity' when designing models with many hyperparameters. We apply the new models to the interpolation of neuronal spike data and demonstrate a substantial improvement in generalization error. ",

The elevator domain poses a combination of challenges not seen in most RL research to date. Elevator systems operate in continuous state spaces and in continuous time as discrete event dynamic systems. Their states are not fully observable and they are nonstationary due to changing passenger arrival rates. In addition, we use a team of RL agents, each of which is responsible for controlling one elevator car. The team receives a global reinforcement signal which appears noisy to each agent due to the effects of the actions of the other agents, the random nature of the arrivals and the incomplete observation of the state. In spite of these complications, we show results that in simulation surpass the best of the heuristic elevator control algorithms of which we are aware. These results demonstrate the power of RL on a very large scale stochastic dynamic optimization problem of practical utility.",

It does this by building a decision tree, using features from the pool, that classifies a set of training examples. The features included in the tree provide a compact description of the training data and are thus suitable for use as inputs to other inductive learning algorithms. Empirical experiments in the protein secondary-structure task, in which sets of complex features chosen by DT-Select are used to augment a standard artificial neural network representation, yield surprisingly little performance gain, even though features are selected from very large feature pools.

Parti-game maintains a decision-tree partitioning of state-space and applies techniques from game-theory and computational geometry to efficiently and adaptively concentrate high resolution only on critical areas. The current version of the algorithm is designed to find feasible paths or trajectories to goal regions in high dimensional spaces. Future versions will be designed to find a solution that optimizes a real-valued criterion.

We consider three approaches for computing this predictive distribution, and assume that the joint probability distribution for the variables belongs to a set of distributions determined by a set of parametric models. In the simplest case, the predictive distribution is computed by using the model with the maximum a posteriori (MAP) posterior probability. In the evidence approach, the predictive distribution is obtained by averaging over all the individual models in the model family. In the third case, we define the predictive distribution by using Rissanen's new definition of stochastic complexity. Our experiments performed with the family of Naive Bayes models suggest that when using all the data available, the stochastic complexity approach produces the most accurate predictions in the log-score sense. However, when the amount of available training data is decreased, the evidence approach clearly outperforms the two other approaches. The MAP predictive distribution is clearly inferior in the log-score sense to the two more sophisticated approaches, but for the 0/1-score the MAP approach may still in some cases produce the best results.

We give lower bounds implying that our upper bounds cannot be improved by more than a constant factor in general. We apply this result, together with techniques due to Haussler and to Benedek and Itai, to obtain new upper bounds on packing numbers in terms of this scale-sensitive notion of dimension. Using a different technique, we obtain new bounds on packing numbers in terms of Kearns and Schapire's fat-shattering function. We show how to apply both packing bounds to obtain improved general bounds on the sample complexity of agnostic learning.

If the state of the world is known at all times, the world can be modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). MDPs have been studied extensively and many methods are known for determining optimal courses of action, or policies. The more realistic case where state information is only partially observable, Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), have received much less attention. The best exact algorithms for these problems can be very inefficient in both space and time. We introduce Smooth Partially Observable Value Approximation (SPOVA), a new approximation method that can quickly yield good approximations which can improve over time. This method can be combined with reinforcement learning methods, a combination that was very effective in our test cases. ",

The information processing transforms discovered through generation are fine-tuned by feedback-guided reweight-ing of links. Some preliminary results are presented of brain-structured networks that learn to recognize simple objects (e.g., letters of the alphabet, cups, apples, bananas) through feedback-guided generation and reweighting.

Several alternative designs as well as a range of control structures and processes which can be used to regulate the form and content of internal representations learned by such networks are examined.

This classical problem has received much attention because of the simple model it provides of the trade-off between exploration (trying out each arm to find the best one) and exploitation (playing the arm believed to give the best payoff). Past solutions for the bandit problem have almost always relied on assumptions about the statistics of the slot machines. In this work, we make no statistical assumptions whatsoever about the nature of the process generating the payoffs of the slot machines. We give a solution to the bandit problem in which an adversary, rather than a well-behaved stochastic process, has complete control over the payoffs. In a sequence of T plays, we prove that the expected per-round payoff of our algorithm approaches that of the best arm at the rate O(T 1=2 ), and we give an improved rate of convergence when the best arm has fairly low payoff. We also prove a general matching lower bound on the best possible performance of any algorithm in our setting. In addition, we consider a setting in which the player has a team of experts advising him on which arm to play; here, we give a strategy that will guarantee expected payoff close to that of the best expert. Finally, we apply our result to the problem of learning to play an unknown repeated matrix game against an all-powerful adversary.",

For visual processing, researchers have long argued that an attentional mechanism is required to perform many of the tasks required by high level vision. This thesis presents VISIT, a connectionist model of covert visual attention that has been used as a vehicle for studying this interface. The model is efficient, exible, and is biologically plausible. The complexity of the network is linear in the number of pixels. Effective parallel strategies are used to minimize the number of iterations required. The resulting system is able to efficiently solve two tasks that are particularly difficult for standard bottom-up models of vision: computing spatial relations and visual search. Simulations show that the networks behavior matches much of the known psychophysical data on human visual attention. The general architecture of the model also closely matches the known physiological data on the human attention system.

The construction assumes symmetric interactions within excitatory and inhibitory populations of neurons, and antisymmetric interactions between populations. The Lyapunov function yields sufficient conditions for the global asymptotic stability of fixed points. If these conditions are violated, limit cycles may be stable. The relations of the Lyapunov function to optimization theory and classical mechanics are revealed by The dynamics of a neural network with symmetric interactions provably converges to fixed points under very general assumptions[1, 2]. This mathematical result helped to establish the paradigm of neural computation with fixed point attractors[3]. But in reality, interactions between neurons in the brain are asymmetric. Furthermore, the dynamical behaviors seen in the brain are not confined to fixed point attractors, but also include oscillations and complex nonperiodic behavior. These other types of dynamics can be realized by asymmetric networks, and may be useful for neural computation. For these reasons, it is important to understand the global behavior of asymmetric neural networks. The interaction between an excitatory neuron and an inhibitory neuron is clearly asymmetric. Here we consider a class of networks that incorporates this fundamental asymmetry of the brain's microcircuitry. Networks of this class have distinct populations of excitatory and inhibitory neurons, with antisymmetric interactions minimax and dissipative Hamiltonian forms of the network dynamics.",

Rather than collect a large training sample that can be proved sufficient to eliminate all bad hypotheses a priori, the idea is instead to observe training examples one-at-a-time and decide \"on-line\" whether to stop and return a hypothesis, or continue training. The primary benefit of this approach is that we can detect when a hypothesizer has actually \"converged,\" and halt training before the standard fixed-sample-size bounds. This paper presents a series of such sequential learning procedures for: distribution-free pac-learning, \"mistake-bounded to pac\" conversion, and distribution-specific pac-learning, respectively. We analyze the worst case expected training sample size of these procedures, and show that this is often smaller than existing fixed sample size bounds | while providing the exact same worst case pac-guarantees. We also provide lower bounds that show these reductions can at best involve constant (and possibly log) factors.

We advance structural similarity assessment which provides not only a single numeric value but the most specific structure two cases have in common, inclusive of the modification rules needed to obtain this structure from the two cases. Our approach treats retrieval, matching and adaptation as a group of dependent processes. This guarantees the retrieval and matching of not only similar but adaptable cases. Both together enlarge the overall problem solving performance of Cbr and the explainability of case selection and adaptation considerably. Although our approach is more theoretical in nature and not restricted to a specific domain, we will give an example taken from the domain of industrial building design. Additionally, we will sketch two prototypical implementations of this approach.",

We identify three types of blame-assignment tasks that differ in the types of information they take as input: the design does not achieve a desired behavior of the device, the design results in an undesirable behavior, a specific structural element in the design misbehaves. We then describe a model-based approach for solving the blame-assignment task. This approach uses structure-behavior-function models that capture a designer's comprehension of the way a device works in terms of causal explanations of how its structure results in its behaviors. We also address the issue of indexing the models in memory. We discuss how the three types of blame-assignment tasks require different types of indices for accessing the models. Finally we describe the KRITIK2 system that implements and evaluates this model-based approach to blame assignment.",

Different types of knowledge that enter the knowledge base of a design support system are defined and illustrated both from a formal and from a knowledge acquisition vantage point. Special emphasis is placed on the task-structure, which is used to guide both acquisition and application of knowledge. Starting with knowledge for planning steps in design and augmenting this with problem-solving knowledge that supports design, a formal integrated model of knowledge for design is constructed. Based on the notion of knowledge acquisition as an incremental process we give an account of possibilities for problem solving depending on the knowledge that is at the disposal of the system. Finally, we depict how different kinds of knowledge interact in a design support system. ?

In this paper we describe the notion of a meta-case for illustrating, explaining and justifying case-based reasoning. A meta-case contains a trace of the processing in a problem-solving episode, and provides an explanation of the problem-solving decisions and a (partial) justification for the solution. The language for representing the problem-solving trace depends on the model of problem solving.

The requirement of maintaining product inventories in the face of unpredictable demand and stochastic factory output makes standard scheduling models, such as job-shop, inadequate. Currently applied algorithms, such as simulated annealing and constraint propagation, must employ ad-hoc methods such as frequent replanning to cope with uncertainty. In this paper, we describe a Markov Decision Process (MDP) formulation of production scheduling which captures stochasticity in both production and demands. The solution to this MDP is a value function which can be used to generate optimal scheduling decisions online. A simple example illustrates the theoretical superiority of this approach over replanning-based methods. We then describe an industrial application and two reinforcement learning methods for generating an approximate value function on this domain. Our results demonstrate that in both deterministic and noisy scenarios, value function approx imation is an effective technique. ",

Because of global connectivity, WTA networks, however, do not encode spatial relations in the input, and thus cannot support sensory and perceptual processing where spatial relations are important. We propose a new architecture that maintains spatial relations between input features. This selection network builds on LEGION (Locally Excitatory Globally Inhibitory Oscillator Networks) dynamics and slow inhibition. In an input scene with many objects (patterns), the network selects the largest object. This system can be easily adjusted to select several largest objects, which then alternate in time. We further show that a twostage selection network gains efficiency by combining selection with parallel removal of noisy regions. The network is applied to select the most salient object in real images. As a special case, the selection network without local excitation gives rise to a new form of oscillatory WTA. ",

RL researchers have focussed almost exclusively on problems where the controller has to maximize the discounted sum of payoffs. However, as emphasized by Schwartz (1993), in many problems, e.g., those for which the optimal behavior is a limit cycle, it is more natural and com-putationally advantageous to formulate tasks so that the controller's objective is to maximize the average payoff received per time step. In this paper I derive new average-payoff RL algorithms as stochastic approximation methods for solving the system of equations associated with the policy evaluation and optimal control questions in average-payoff RL tasks. These algorithms are analogous to the popular TD and Q-learning algorithms already developed for the discounted-payoff case. One of the algorithms derived here is a significant variation of Schwartz's R-learning algorithm. Preliminary empirical results are presented to validate these new algorithms. ",

In this paper I consider a class of sequential decision tasks (SDTs), called composite sequential decision tasks, formed by temporally concatenating a number of elemental sequential decision tasks. Elemental SDTs cannot be decomposed into simpler SDTs. I consider a learning agent that has to learn to solve a set of elemental and composite SDTs. I assume that the structure of the composite tasks is unknown to the learning agent. The straightforward application of reinforcement learning to multiple tasks requires learning the tasks separately, which can waste computational resources, both memory and time. I present a new learning algorithm and a modular architecture that learns the decomposition of composite SDTs, and achieves transfer of learning by sharing the solutions of elemental SDTs across multiple composite SDTs. The solution of a composite SDT is constructed by computationally inexpensive modifications of the solutions of its constituent elemental SDTs.

Although such temporal-difference methods have been used in Samuel's checker player, Holland's bucket brigade, and the author's Adaptive Heuristic Critic, they have remained poorly understood. Here we prove their convergence and optimality for special cases and relate them to supervised-learning methods. For most real-world prediction problems, temporal-difference methods require less memory and less peak computation than conventional methods; and they produce more accurate predictions. We argue that most problems to which supervised learning is currently applied are really prediction problems of the sort to which temporal-difference methods can be applied to advantage. ",

In these cases there are no strong theoretical results on the accuracy of convergence, and computational results have been mixed. In particular, Boyan and Moore reported at last year's meeting a series of negative results in attempting to apply dynamic programming together with function approximation to simple control problems with continuous state spaces. In this paper, we present positive results for all the control tasks they attempted, and for one that is significantly larger. The most important differences are that we used sparse-coarse-coded function approximators (CMACs) whereas they used mostly global function approximators, and that we learned online whereas they learned o*ine. Boyan and Moore and others have suggested that the problems they encountered could be solved by using actual outcomes (\"rollouts\"), as in classical Monte Carlo methods, and as in the TD() algorithm when = 1. However, in our experiments this always resulted in substantially poorer performance. We conclude that reinforcement learning can work robustly in conjunction with function approximators, and that there is little justification at present for avoiding the case of general .",

The dependency is measured by the average mutual information (MI) of the outputs. The source signals and the mixing matrix are unknown except for the number of the sources. The Gram-Charlier expansion instead of the Edgeworth expansion is used in evaluating the MI. The natural gradient approach is used to minimize the MI. A novel activation function is proposed for the on-line learning algorithm which has an equivariant property and is easily implemented on a neural network like model.

It describes the deterioration of gen-eralisation performance of a trained model. In this paper, we investigate the ability of a novel artificial neural network, bp-som, to avoid overfitting. bp-som is a hybrid neural network which combines a multi-layered feed-forward network (mfn) with Kohonen's self-organising maps (soms). During training, supervised back-propagation learning and unsupervised som learning cooperate in finding adequate hidden-layer representations. We show that bp-som outperforms standard backpropagation, and also back-propagation with a weight decay when dealing with the problem of overfitting. In addition, we show that bp-som succeeds in preserving generalisation performance under hidden-unit pruning, where both other methods fail.",

It is widely acknowledged that to be of use in complex domains, reinforcement learning techniques must be combined with generalizing function approximation methods such as artificial neural networks. Little, however, is understood about the theoretical properties of such combinations, and many researchers have encountered failures in practice. In this paper we identify a prime source of such failuresnamely, a systematic overestimation of utility values. Using Watkins' Q-Learning [18] as an example, we give a theoretical account of the phenomenon, deriving conditions under which one may expected it to cause learning to fail. Employing some of the most popular function approximators, we present experimental results which support the theoretical findings. ",

The algorithm does not assume any knowledge of the input distributions, and is defined here for the zero-noise limit. Under these conditions, information maximisation has extra properties not found in the linear case (Linsker 1989). The non-linearities in the transfer function are able to pick up higher-order moments of the input distributions and perform something akin to true redundancy reduction between units in the output representation. This enables the network to separate statistically independent components in the inputs: a higher-order generalisation of Principal Components Analysis. We apply the network to the source separation (or cocktail party) problem, successfully separating unknown mixtures of up to ten speakers. We also show that a variant on the network architecture is able to perform blind deconvolution (cancellation of unknown echoes and reverberation in a speech signal). Finally, we derive dependencies of information transfer on time delays. We suggest that information max-imisation provides a unifying framework for problems in `blind' signal processing. fl Please send comments to tony@salk.edu.

Well-known examples of graphical models include Bayesian networks, directed graphs representing a Markov chain, and undirected networks representing a Markov field. These graphical models are extended to model data analysis and empirical learning using the notation of plates. Graphical operations for simplifying and manipulating a problem are provided including decomposition, differentiation, and the manipulation of probability models from the exponential family. Two standard algorithm schemas for learning are reviewed in a graphical framework: Gibbs sampling and the expectation maximization algorithm. Using these operations and schemas, some popular algorithms can be synthesized from their graphical specification. This includes versions of linear regression, techniques for feed-forward networks, and learning Gaussian and discrete Bayesian networks from data. The paper concludes by sketching some implications for data analysis and summarizing how some popular algorithms fall within the framework presented. ",

Most machine learning techniques have been studied in the context of knowledge acquisition for well defined tasks, such as classification. Learning for these tasks can be handled by relatively simple algorithms. Complex domains present difficulties that can be approached by combining the strengths of several complementing learning techniques, and overcoming their weaknesses by providing alternative learning strategies. This study presents two perspectives, the macro and the micro, for viewing the issue of multistrategy learning. The macro perspective deals with the decomposition of an overall complex learning task into relatively well-defined learning tasks, and the micro perspective deals with designing multistrategy learning techniques for supporting the acquisition of knowledge for each task.

Introspection requires declarative representations of meta-knowledge of the reasoning performed by the system during the performance task, of the system's knowledge, and of the organization of this knowledge. This chapter presents a taxonomy of possible reasoning failures that can occur during a performance task, declarative representations of these failures, and associations between failures and particular learning strategies. The theory is based on Meta-XPs, which are explanation structures that help the system identify failure types, formulate learning goals, and choose appropriate learning strategies in order to avoid similar mistakes in the future. The theory is implemented in a computer model of an introspective reasoner that performs multistrategy learning during a story understanding task. ",

When the replayed path cannot be extended into a new solution, explanation-based learning (ebl) techniques are employed to identify the features of the new problem which prevent this extension. These features are then added as censors on the retrieval of the stored case. To keep retrieval costs low, dersnlp+ebl normally stores plan derivations for individual goals, and replays one or more of these derivations in solving multi-goal problems. Cases covering multiple goals are stored only when subplans for individual goals cannot be successfully merged. The aim in constructing the case library is to predict these goal interactions and to store a multi-goal case for each set of negatively interacting goals. We provide empirical results demonstrating the effectiveness of dersnlp+ebl in improving planning performance on randomly-generated problems drawn from a complex domain. ",

However, certain branches are difficult to predict. One solution to this problem is to evaluate both paths following such a conditional branch. Predicated execution can be used to implement this form of multi-path execution. Predicated architectures fetch and issue instructions that have associated predicates. These predicates indicate if the instruction should commit its result. Predicating a branch reduces the number of branches executed, eliminating the chance of branch misprediction at the cost of executing additional instructions. In this paper, we propose a restricted form of multi-path execution called Dynamic Predication for architectures with little or no support for predicated instructions in their instruction set. Dynamic predication dynamically predicates instruction sequences in the form of a branch hammock, concurrently executing both paths of the branch. A branch hammock is a short forward branch that spans a few instructions in the form of an if-then or if-then-else construct. We mark these and other constructs in the executable. When the decode stage detects such a sequence, it passes a predicated instruction sequence to a dynamically scheduled execution core. Our results show that dynamic predication can accrue speedups of up to 13%. ",

Many of these emulate natural speciation. For co-evolutionary learning to succeed in a range of management and control problems, such as learning game strategies, such methods must find all or most optima. However, suitable comparison studies are rare. We compare two similar GA specia-tion methods, fitness sharing and implicit sharing. Using a realistic letter classification problem, we find they have advantages under different circumstances. Implicit sharing covers optima more comprehensively, when the population is large enough for a species to form at each optimum. With a population not large enough to do this, fitness sharing can find the optima with larger basins of attraction, and ignore the peaks with narrow bases, while implicit sharing is more easily distracted. This indicates that for a speciated GA trying to find as many near-global optima as possible, implicit sharing works well only if the population is large enough. This requires prior knowledge of how many peaks exist.",

The construction of a heterogeneous knowledge system that can support practical design thus raises two fundamental questions: how to accumulate huge volumes of design information, and how to support heterogeneous design processing? Fortunately, partial answers to both questions exist separately. Legacy databases already contain huge amounts of general-purpose design information. In addition, modern knowledge systems typically characterize the kinds of knowledge needed by specific problem-solving methods quite precisely. This leads us to hypothesize method-specific data-to-knowledge compilation as a potential mechanism for integrating heterogeneous knowledge systems and legacy databases for design. In this paper, first we outline a general computational architecture called HIPED for this integration. Then, we focus on the specific issue of how to convert data accessed from a legacy database into a form appropriate to the problem-solving method used in a heterogeneous knowledge system. We describe an experiment in which a legacy knowledge system called Interactive Kritik is integrated with an ORACLE database using IDI as the communication tool. The limited experiment indicates the computational feasibility of method-specific data-to-knowledge compilation, but also raises additional research issues. ",

The pattern sequence contains successive views of faces of ten individuals as they change pose. Under the network dynamics developed by Griniasty, Tsodyks & Amit (1993), multiple views of a given subject fall into the same basin of attraction. We use an independent component (ICA) representation of the faces for the input patterns (Bell & Sejnowski, 1995).

    "text": "Title: Regularization Theory and Neural Networks Architectures  \nAbstract: We had previously shown that regularization principles lead to approximation schemes which are equivalent to networks with one layer of hidden units, called Regularization Networks. In particular, standard smoothness functionals lead to a subclass of regularization networks, the well known Radial Basis Functions approximation schemes. This paper shows that regularization networks encompass a much broader range of approximation schemes, including many of the popular general additive models and some of the neural networks. In particular, we introduce new classes of smoothness functionals that lead to different classes of basis functions. Additive splines as well as some tensor product splines can be obtained from appropriate classes of smoothness functionals. Furthermore, the same generalization that extends Radial Basis Functions (RBF) to Hyper Basis Functions (HBF) also leads from additive models to ridge approximation models, containing as special cases Breiman's hinge functions, some forms of Projection Pursuit Regression and several types of neural networks. We propose to use the term Generalized Regularization Networks for this broad class of approximation schemes that follow from an extension of regularization. In the probabilistic interpretation of regularization, the different classes of basis functions correspond to different classes of prior probabilities on the approximating function spaces, and therefore to different types of smoothness assumptions. In summary, different multilayer networks with one hidden layer, which we collectively call Generalized Regularization Networks, correspond to different classes of priors and associated smoothness functionals in a classical regularization principle. Three broad classes are a) Radial Basis Functions that can be generalized to Hyper Basis Functions, b) some tensor product splines, and c) additive splines that can be generalized to schemes of the type of ridge approximation, hinge functions and several perceptron-like neural networks with one-hidden layer. 1 This paper will appear on Neural Computation, vol. 7, pages 219-269, 1995.

    "text": "Title: Interactive Segmentation of Three-dimensional Medical Images (Extended abstract)  \nAbstract: We had previously shown that regularization principles lead to approximation schemes which are equivalent to networks with one layer of hidden units, called Regularization Networks. In particular, standard smoothness functionals lead to a subclass of regularization networks, the well known Radial Basis Functions approximation schemes. This paper shows that regularization networks encompass a much broader range of approximation schemes, including many of the popular general additive models and some of the neural networks. In particular, we introduce new classes of smoothness functionals that lead to different classes of basis functions. Additive splines as well as some tensor product splines can be obtained from appropriate classes of smoothness functionals. Furthermore, the same generalization that extends Radial Basis Functions (RBF) to Hyper Basis Functions (HBF) also leads from additive models to ridge approximation models, containing as special cases Breiman's hinge functions, some forms of Projection Pursuit Regression and several types of neural networks. We propose to use the term Generalized Regularization Networks for this broad class of approximation schemes that follow from an extension of regularization. In the probabilistic interpretation of regularization, the different classes of basis functions correspond to different classes of prior probabilities on the approximating function spaces, and therefore to different types of smoothness assumptions. In summary, different multilayer networks with one hidden layer, which we collectively call Generalized Regularization Networks, correspond to different classes of priors and associated smoothness functionals in a classical regularization principle. Three broad classes are a) Radial Basis Functions that can be generalized to Hyper Basis Functions, b) some tensor product splines, and c) additive splines that can be generalized to schemes of the type of ridge approximation, hinge functions and several perceptron-like neural networks with one-hidden layer. 1 This paper will appear on Neural Computation, vol. 7, pages 219-269, 1995.

Then, by using example-based learning techniques, we develop networks for performing analysis tasks such as pose and expression estimation, face recognition, and face detection in cluttered scenes.

    "text": "Title: A Generalized Hidden Markov Model for the Recognition of Human Genes in DNA  \nAbstract: We present a statistical model of genes in DNA. A Generalized Hidden Markov Model (GHMM) provides the framework for describing the grammar of a legal parse of a DNA sequence (Stormo & Haussler 1994). Probabilities are assigned to transitions between states in the GHMM and to the generation of each nucleotide base given a particular state. Machine learning techniques are applied to optimize these probabilities using a standardized training set. Given a new candidate sequence, the best parse is deduced from the model using a dynamic programming algorithm to identify the path through the model with maximum probability. The GHMM is flexible and modular, so new sensors and additional states can be inserted easily. In addition, it provides simple solutions for integrating cardinality constraints, reading frame constraints, \"indels\", and homology searching. The description and results of an implementation of such a gene-finding model, called Genie, is presented. The exon sensor is a codon frequency model conditioned on windowed nucleotide frequency and the preceding codon. Two neural networks are used, as in (Brunak, Engelbrecht, & Knudsen 1991), for splice site prediction. We show that this simple model performs quite well. For a cross-validated standard test set of 304 genes [ftp://www-hgc.lbl.gov/pub/genesets] in human DNA, our gene-finding system identified up to 85% of protein-coding bases correctly with a specificity of 80%. 58% of exons were exactly identified with a specificity of 51%. Genie is shown to perform favorably compared with several other gene-finding systems. ",

MORGAN uses a variety of techniques to accomplish this task, the most distinctive of which is a decision tree classifier. The decision tree system is combined with new methods for identifying start codons, donor sites, and acceptor sites, and these are brought together in a frame-sensitive dynamic programming algorithm that finds the optimal segmentation of a DNA sequence into coding and noncoding regions (exons and introns). The optimal segmentation is dependent on a separate scoring function that takes a subsequence and assigns to it a score reflecting the probability that the sequence is an exon. The scoring functions in MORGAN are sets of decision trees that are combined to give a probability estimate. Experimental results on a database of 570 vertebrate DNA sequences show that MORGAN has excellent performance by many different measures. On a separate test set, it achieves an overall accuracy of 95%, with a correlation coefficient of 0.78 and a sensitivity and specificity for coding bases of 83% and 79%. In addition, MORGAN identifies 58% of coding exons exactly; i.e., both the beginning and end of the coding regions are predicted correctly. This paper describes the MORGAN system, including its decision tree routines and the algorithms for site recognition, and its performance on a benchmark database of vertebrate DNA. ",

The performance of various solution methods on previously seen similar classes of models is then used as a basis for predicting what method to use. Thus, a major step of the reasoning process in PYTHIA involves the analysis and categorization of models into classes of models based on their characteristics.

The lack of a satisfactory, generic complexity measure for learning problems poses difficulties for researchers in various areas; the present paper puts forward an idea which may help to alleviate these. It shows that supervised learning problems fall into two, generic, complexity classes only one of which is associated with computational tractability.

Scatter-partitioning Radial Basis Function (RBF) networks increase their number of degrees of freedom with the complexity of an input-output mapping to be estimated on the basis of a supervised training data set. Due to its superior expressive power a scatter-partitioning Gaussian RBF (GRBF) model, termed Supervised Growing Neural Gas (SGNG), is selected from the literature. SGNG employs a one-stage error-driven learning strategy and is capable of generating and removing both hidden units and synaptic connections. A slightly modified SGNG version is tested as a function estimator when the training surface to be fitted is an image, i.e., a 2-D signal whose size is finite. The relationship between the generation, by the learning system, of disjointed maps of hidden units and the presence, in the image, of pictorially homogeneous subsets (segments) is investigated. Unfortunately, the examined SGNG version performs poorly both as function estimator and image segmenter. This may be due to an intrinsic inadequacy of the one-stage error-driven learning strategy to adjust structural parameters and output weights simultaneously but consistently. In the framework of RBF networks, further studies should investigate the combination of two-stage error-driven learning strategies with synapse generation and removal criteria. y Internal report of the paper entitled \"Image segmentation with scatter-partitioning RBF networks: A feasibility study,\" to be presented at the conference Applications and Science of Neural Networks, Fuzzy Systems, and Evolutionary Computation, part of SPIE's International Symposium on Optical Science, Engineering and Instrumentation, 19-24 July 1998, San Diego, CA.

U-Tree uses a tree-structured representation, and is related to work on Prediction Suffix Trees [ Ron et al., 1994 ] , Parti-game [ Moore, 1993 ] , G-algorithm [ Chap-man and Kaelbling, 1991 ] , and Variable Resolution Dynamic Programming [ Moore, 1991 ] . It builds on Utile Suffix Memory [ McCallum, 1995c ] , which only used short-term memory, not selective perception. The algorithm is demonstrated solving a highway driving task in which the agent weaves around slower and faster traffic. The agent uses active perception with simulated eye movements. The environment has hidden state, time pressure, stochasticity, over 21,000 world states and over 2,500 percepts. From this environment and sensory system, the agent uses a utile distinction test to build a tree that represents depth-three memory where necessary, and has just 143 internal statesfar fewer than the 2500 3 states that would have resulted from a fixed-sized history-window ap proach.",

    "text": "Title: Perceptual Development and Learning: From Behavioral, Neurophysiological, and Morphological Evidence To Computational Models  \nAbstract: An intelligent system has to be capable of adapting to a constantly changing environment. It therefore, ought to be capable of learning from its perceptual interactions with its surroundings. This requires a certain amount of plasticity in its structure. Any attempt to model the perceptual capabilities of a living system or, for that matter, to construct a synthetic system of comparable abilities, must therefore, account for such plasticity through a variety of developmental and learning mechanisms. This paper examines some results from neuroanatomical, morphological, as well as behavioral studies of the development of visual perception; integrates them into a computational framework; and suggests several interesting experiments with computational models that can yield insights into the development of visual perception. In order to understand the development of information processing structures in the brain, one needs knowledge of changes it undergoes from birth to maturity in the context of a normal environment. However, knowledge of its development in aberrant settings is also extremely useful, because it reveals the extent to which the development is a function of environmental experience (as opposed to genetically determined pre-wiring). Accordingly, we consider development of the visual system under both normal and restricted rearing conditions. The role of experience in the early development of the sensory systems in general, and the visual system in particular, has been widely studied through a variety of experiments involving carefully controlled manipulation of the environment presented to an animal. Extensive reviews of such results can be found in (Mitchell, 1984; Movshon, 1981; Hirsch, 1986; Boothe, 1986; Singer, 1986). Some examples of manipulation of visual experience are total pattern deprivation (e.g., dark rearing), selective deprivation of a certain class of patterns (e.g., vertical lines), monocular deprivation in animals with binocular vision, etc. Extensive studies involving behavioral deficits resulting from total visual pattern deprivation indicate that the deficits arise primarily as a result of impairment of visual information processing in the brain. The results of these experiments suggest specific developmental or learning mechanisms that may be operating at various stages of development, and at different levels in the system. We will discuss some of these hhhhhhhhhhhhhhh This is a working draft. All comments, especially constructive criticism and suggestions for improvement, will be appreciated. I am indebted to Prof. James Dannemiller for introducing me to some of the literature in infant development; to Prof. Leonard Uhr for his helpful comments on an initial draft of the paper; and to numerous researchers whose experimental work has provided the basis for the model outlined in this paper.

URL of this paper: ftp://ftp.cs.colorado.edu/pub/Time-Series/MyPapers/experts.ps.Z, or http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~andreas/Time-Series/MyPapers/experts.ps.Z University of Colorado Computer Science Technical Report CU-CS-798-95. In the analysis and prediction of real-world systems, two of the key problems are nonstationarity(often in the form of switching between regimes), and overfitting (particularly serious for noisy processes). This article addresses these problems using gated experts, consisting of a (nonlinear) gating network, and several (also nonlinear) competing experts. Each expert learns to predict the conditional mean, and each expert adapts its width to match the noise level in its regime. The gating network learns to predict the probability of each expert, given the input. This article focuses on the case where the gating network bases its decision on information from the inputs. This can be contrasted to hidden Markov models where the decision is based on the previous state(s) (i.e., on the output of the gating network at the previous time step), as well as to averaging over several predictors. In contrast, gated experts soft-partition the input space. This article discusses the underlying statistical assumptions, derives the weight update rules, and compares the performance of gated experts to standard methods on three time series: (1) a computer-generated series, obtained by randomly switching between two nonlinear processes, (2) a time series from the Santa Fe Time Series Competition (the light intensity of a laser in chaotic state), and (3) the daily electricity demand of France, a real-world multivariate problem with structure on several time scales. The main results are (1) the gating network correctly discovers the different regimes of the process, (2) the widths associated with each expert are important for the segmentation task (and they can be used to characterize the sub-processes), and (3) there is less overfitting compared to single networks (homogeneous multi-layer perceptrons), since the experts learn to match their variances to the (local) noise levels. This can be viewed as matching the local complexity of the model to the local complexity of the data. ",

The uniqueness of our approach stems from the fact that the mapping process is very forgiving in that the query received from the front end is evaluated with respect to a large number of possibilities. These possibilities are encoded in the form of rules that consider various ways in which the tokens in the given query may match relation names, attrribute names, or values in the underlying tables.

These results are representation independent, in that they hold regardless of the syntactic form in which the learner chooses to represent its hypotheses. Our methods reduce the problems of cracking a number of well-known public-key cryptosys- tems to the learning problems. We prove that a polynomial-time learning algorithm for Boolean formulae, deterministic finite automata or constant-depth threshold circuits would have dramatic consequences for cryptography and number theory: in particular, such an algorithm could be used to break the RSA cryptosystem, factor Blum integers (composite numbers equivalent to 3 modulo 4), and detect quadratic residues. The results hold even if the learning algorithm is only required to obtain a slight advantage in prediction over random guessing. The techniques used demonstrate an interesting duality between learning and cryptography. We also apply our results to obtain strong intractability results for approximating a gener - alization of graph coloring. fl This research was conducted while the author was at Harvard University and supported by an A.T.& T.

We show that such networks can be designed by repeated transformations of one objective into another with the same fixpoints. We exhibit a collection of algebraic transformations which reduce network cost and increase the set of objective functions that are neurally implementable. The transformations include simplification of products of expressions, functions of one or two expressions, and sparse matrix products (all of which may be interpreted as Legendre transformations); also the minimum and maximum of a set of expressions. These transformations introduce new interneurons which force the network to seek a saddle point rather than a minimum. Other transformations allow control of the network dynamics, by reconciling the Lagrangian formalism with the need for fixpoints. We apply the transformations to simplify a number of structured neural networks, beginning with the standard reduction of the winner-take-all network from O(N 2 ) connections to O(N ). Also susceptible are inexact graph-matching, random dot matching, convolutions and coordinate transformations, and sorting. Simulations show that fixpoint-preserving transformations may be applied repeatedly and elaborately, and the example networks still robustly converge. ",

The model utilizes a hierarchical network whose successive levels implement Kalman filters operating over successively larger spatial and temporal scales. Each hierarchical level in the network predicts the current visual recognition state at a lower level and adapts its own recognition state using the residual error between the prediction and the actual lower-level state. Simultaneously, the network also learns an internal model of the spatiotemporal dynamics of the input stream by adapting the synaptic weights at each hierarchical level in order to minimize prediction errors. The Kalman filter model respects key neuroanatomical data such as the reciprocity of connections between visual cortical areas, and assigns specific computational roles to the inter-laminar connections known to exist between neurons in the visual cortex. Previous work elucidated the usefulness of this model in explaining neurophysiological phenomena such as endstopping and other related extra-classical receptive field effects. In this paper, in addition to providing a more detailed exposition of the model, we present a variety of experimental results demonstrating the ability of this model to perform robust spatiotemporal segmentation and recognition of objects and image sequences in the presence of varying amounts of occlusion, background clutter, and noise.

The first variant performs unsupervised learning and can be used for data visualization, clustering, and vector quantization. The main advantage over existing approaches, e.g., the Kohonen feature map, is the ability of the model to automatically find a suitable network structure and size. This is achieved through a controlled growth process which also includes occasional removal of units. The second variant of the model is a supervised learning method which results from the combination of the abovementioned self-organizing network with the radial basis function (RBF) approach. In this model it is possible in contrast to earlier approaches toperform the positioning of the RBF units and the supervised training of the weights in parallel. Therefore, the current classification error can be used to determine where to insert new RBF units. This leads to small networks which generalize very well.

    "text": "Title: GAL: Networks that grow when they learn and shrink when they forget  \nAbstract: Learning when limited to modification of some parameters has a limited scope; the capability to modify the system structure is also needed to get a wider range of the learnable. In the case of artificial neural networks, learning by iterative adjustment of synaptic weights can only succeed if the network designer predefines an appropriate network structure, i.e., number of hidden layers, units, and the size and shape of their receptive and projective fields. This paper advocates the view that the network structure should not, as usually done, be determined by trial-and-error but should be computed by the learning algorithm. Incremental learning algorithms can modify the network structure by addition and/or removal of units and/or links. A survey of current connectionist literature is given on this line of thought. \"Grow and Learn\" (GAL) is a new algorithm that learns an association at one-shot due to being incremental and using a local representation. During the so-called \"sleep\" phase, units that were previously stored but which are no longer necessary due to recent modifications are removed to minimize network complexity. The incrementally constructed network can later be finetuned off-line to improve performance. Another method proposed that greatly increases recognition accuracy is to train a number of networks and vote over their responses. The algorithm and its variants are tested on recognition of handwritten numerals and seem promising especially in terms of learning speed. This makes the algorithm attractive for on-line learning tasks, e.g., in robotics. The biological plausibility of incremental learning is also discussed briefly.

Abstract To achieve high performance, contemporary computer systems rely on two forms of parallelism: instruction-level parallelism (ILP) and thread-level parallelism (TLP). Wide-issue superscalar processors exploit ILP by executing multiple instructions from a single program in a single cycle. Multiprocessors (MP) exploit TLP by executing different threads in parallel on different processors. Unfortunately, both parallel-processing styles statically partition processor resources, thus preventing them from adapting to dynamically-changing levels of ILP and TLP in a program. With insufficient TLP, processors in an MP will be idle; with insufficient ILP, multiple-issue hardware on a superscalar is wasted. This paper explores parallel processing on an alternative architecture, simultaneous multithreading (SMT), which allows multiple threads to compete for and share all of the processors resources every cycle. The most compelling reason for running parallel applications on an SMT processor is its ability to use thread-level parallelism and instruction-level parallelism interchangeably. By permitting multiple threads to share the processors functional units simultaneously, the processor can use both ILP and TLP to accommodate variations in parallelism. When a program has only a single thread, all of the SMT processors resources can be dedicated to that thread; when more TLP exists, this parallelism can compensate for a lack of ",

Artificial\nAbstract: Draft A Brief Introduction to Neural Networks Richard D. De Veaux Lyle H. Ungar Williams College University of Pennsylvania Abstract Artificial neural networks are being used with increasing frequency for high dimensional problems of regression or classification. This article provides a tutorial overview of neural networks, focusing on back propagation networks as a method for approximating nonlinear multivariable functions. We explain, from a statistician's vantage point, why neural networks might be attractive and how they compare to other modern regression techniques. KEYWORDS: nonparametric regression; function approximation; backpropagation. 1 Introduction Networks that mimic the way the brain works; computer programs that actually LEARN patterns; forecasting without having to know statistics. These are just some of the many claims and attractions of artificial neural networks. Neural networks (we will henceforth drop the term artificial, unless we need to distinguish them from biological neural networks) seem to be everywhere these days, and at least in their advertising, are able to do all that statistics can do without all the fuss and bother of having to do anything except buy a piece of software. Neural networks have been successfully used for many different applications including robotics, chemical process control, speech recognition, optical character recognition, credit card fraud detection, interpretation of chemical spectra and vision for autonomous navigation of vehicles. (Pointers to the literature are given at the end of this article.) In this article we will attempt to explain how one particular type of neural network, feedforward networks with sigmoidal activation functions (\"backpropagation networks\") actually works, how it is \"trained\", and how it compares with some more well known statistical techniques. As an example of why someone would want to use a neural network, consider the problem of recognizing hand written ZIP codes on letters. This is a classification problem, where the 1 ",

Annual Mathematical Statistics, 33:1065-1076, 1962.\nAbstract: To apply the algorithm for classification we assign each class a separate set of codebook Gaussians. Each set is only trained with patterns from a single class. After having trained the codebook Gaussians, each set provides an estimate of the probability function of one class; just as with Parzen window estimation, we take as the estimate of the pattern distribution the average of all Gaussians in the set. Classification of a pattern may now be done by calculating the probability of each class at the respective sample point, and assigning to the pattern the class with the highest probability. Hence the whole codebook plays a role in the classification of patterns. This is not the case with regular classification schemes using codebooks. We have tested the classification scheme on several classification tasks including the two spiral problem. We compared our algorithm to various other classification algorithms and it came out second; the best algorithm for the applications is the Parzen window estimation. However, the computing time and memory for Parzen window estimation are excessive when compared to our algorithm, and hence, in practical situations, our algorithm is to be preferred. We have developed a fast algorithm which combines attractive properties of both Parzen window estimation and vector quantization. The scale parameter is tuned adaptively and, therefore, is not set in an ad hoc manner. It allows a classification strategy in which all the codebook vectors are taken into account. This yields better results than the standard vector quantization techniques. An interesting topic for further research is to use radially non-symmetric Gaussians. ",

The principle is based on two opposing forces. For each representational unit there is an adaptive predictor which tries to predict the unit from the remaining units. In turn, each unit tries to react to the environment such that it minimizes its predictability. This encourages each unit to filter `abstract concepts' out of the environmental input such that these concepts are statistically independent of those upon which the other units focus. I discuss various simple yet potentially powerful implementations of the principle which aim at finding binary factorial codes (Bar-low et al., 1989), i.e. codes where the probability of the occurrence of a particular input is simply the product of the probabilities of the corresponding code symbols. Such codes are potentially relevant for (1) segmentation tasks, (2) speeding up supervised learning, (3) novelty detection. Methods for finding factorial codes automatically implement Occam's razor for finding codes using a minimal number of units. Unlike previous methods the novel principle has a potential for removing not only linear but also non-linear output redundancy. Illustrative experiments show that algorithms based on the principle of predictability minimization are practically feasible.

It differs from earlier studies in removing non-essential true dependencies that occur as a result of the compiler employing a stack for subroutine linkage. This is a subtle limitation to parallelism that is not readily evident as it appears as a true dependency on the stack pointer. In this paper we show that its removal exposes far more parallelism than has been seen previously. We refer to this type of parallelism as \"parallelism at a distance\" because it requires impossibly large instruction windows for detection. We conclude with two observations: 1) that a single instruction window characteristic of superscalar machines is inadequate for detecting parallelism at a distance; and 2) in order to take advantage of this parallelism the compiler must be involved, or separate threads must be explicitly programmed.

    "text": "Title: The Role of Constraints in Hebbian Learning  \nAbstract: Models of unsupervised correlation-based (Hebbian) synaptic plasticity are typically unstable: either all synapses grow until each reaches the maximum allowed strength, or all synapses decay to zero strength. A common method of avoiding these outcomes is to use a constraint that conserves or limits the total synaptic strength over a cell. We study the dynamical effects of such constraints. Two methods of enforcing a constraint are distinguished, multiplicative and subtractive. For otherwise linear learning rules, multiplicative enforcement of a constraint results in dynamics that converge to the principal eigenvector of the operator determining unconstrained synaptic development. Subtractive enforcement, in contrast, typically leads to a final state in which almost all synaptic strengths reach either the maximum or minimum allowed value. This final state is often dominated by weight configurations other than the principal eigenvector of the unconstrained operator. Multiplicative enforcement yields a \"graded\" receptive field in which most mutually correlated inputs are represented, whereas subtractive enforcement yields a receptive field that is \"sharpened\" to a subset of maximally-correlated inputs. If two equivalent input populations (e.g. two eyes) innervate a common target, multiplicative enforcement prevents their segregation (ocular dominance segregation) when the two populations are weakly correlated; whereas subtractive enforcement allows segregation under these circumstances. These results may be used to understand constraints both over output cells and over input cells. A variety of rules that can implement constrained dynamics are discussed.",

Empirical results in the domains of supersonic transport aircraft and supersonic missile inlets demonstrate that the newly formulated GA can be significantly better than the classical GA in both efficiency and reliability.

In this paper, we reexamine the suitability of trees as a universal model for MSA in light of the broad range of biological questions that MSA's are used to address. A tree model consists of a tree topology and a model of accepted mutations along the branches. After surveying the major applications of MSA, examples from the molecular biology literature are used to illustrate situations in which this tree model fails. This occurs when the relationship between residues in a column cannot be described by a tree; for example, in some structural and functional applications of MSA. It also occurs in situations, such as lateral gene transfer, where an entire gene cannot be modeled by a unique tree. In cases of nonparsimonous data or convergent evolution, it may be difficult to find a consistent mutational model. We hope that this survey will promote dialogue between biologists and computer scientists, leading to more biologically realistic research on MSA.",

Experimental data demonstrates cholinergic suppression of synaptic transmission in layer I (feedback synapses), and a lack of suppression in layer IV (feed-forward synapses). A network with this feature uses local rules to learn mappings which are not linearly separable. During learning, sensory stimuli and desired response are simultaneously presented as input. Feedforward connections form self-organized representations of input, while suppressed feedback connections learn the transpose of feedfor-ward connectivity. During recall, suppression is removed, sensory input activates the self-organized representation, and activity generates the learned response.",

One way to sample from a distribution is to sample uniformly from the region under the plot of its density function. A Markov chain that converges to this uniform distribution can be constructed by alternating uniform sampling in the vertical direction with uniform sampling from the horizontal `slice' defined by the current vertical position. Variations on such `slice sampling' methods can easily be implemented for univariate distributions, and can be used to sample from a multivariate distribution by updating each variable in turn. This approach is often easier to implement than Gibbs sampling, and may be more efficient than easily-constructed versions of the Metropolis algorithm. Slice sampling is therefore attractive in routine Markov chain Monte Carlo applications, and for use by software that automatically generates a Markov chain sampler from a model specification. One can also easily devise overrelaxed versions of slice sampling, which sometimes greatly improve sampling efficiency by suppressing random walk behaviour. Random walks can also be avoided in some slice sampling schemes that simultaneously update all variables. ",

In this way the evolutionary process runs in an environment that has not been unnecessarily constrained. We added, however, a requirement of computability to reject overly complex structures when they took too long for our simulations to evaluate. The results are encouraging. The evolved structures had a surprisingly alien look: they are not based in common knowledge on how to build with brick toys; instead, the computer found ways of its own through the evolutionary search process. We were able to assemble the final designs manually and confirm that they accomplish the objectives introduced with our fitness functions. After some background on related problems, we describe our physical simulation model for two-dimensional Lego structures, and the representation for encoding them and applying evolution. We demonstrate the feasibility of our work with photos of actual objects which were the result of particular optimizations. Finally, we discuss future work and draw some conclusions. In order to evolve both the morphology and behavior of autonomous mechanical devices which can be manufactured, one must have a simulator which operates under several constraints, and a resultant controller which is adaptive enough to cover the gap between simulated and real world. eral space of mechanisms. Conservative - because simulation is never perfect, it should preserve a margin of safety. Efficient - it should be quicker to test in simulation than through physical production and test. Buildable - results should be convertible from a simula tion to a real object Computer Evolution of Buildable Objects Abstract The idea of co-evolution of bodies and brains is becoming popular, but little work has been done in evolution of physical structure because of the lack of a general framework for doing it. Evolution of creatures in simulation has been constrained by the reality gap which implies that resultant objects are usually not buildable. The work we present takes a step in the problem of body evolution by applying evolutionary techniques to the design of structures assembled out of parts. Evolution takes place in a simulator we designed, which computes forces and stresses and predicts failure for 2-dimensional Lego structures.

The question of assessing convergence totally vanishes. Such methods are known as exact or perfect sampling. The approach that has received most attention uses the protocol of coupling from the past devised by Propp and Wilson (Random Structures and Algorithms,1996), in which multiple dependent paths of the chain are run from different initial states at a sequence of initial times going backwards into the past, until they satisfy the condition of coalescence by time 0. When this is achieved the state at time 0 is distributed according to the required target. This process must be implemented very carefully to assure its validity (including appropriate re-use of random number streams), and also requires one of various tricks to enable us to follow infinitely many sample paths with a finite amount of work. With the ultimate objective of Bayesian MCMC with guaranteed convergence, the purpose of this paper is to describe recent efforts to construct exact sampling methods for continuous-state Markov chains. We review existing methods based on gamma-coupling and rejection sampling (Murdoch and Green, Scandinavian Journal of Statistics, 1998), that are quite straightforward to understand, but require a closed form for the transition kernel and entail cumbersome algebraic manipulation. We then introduce two new methods based on random walk Metropolis, that offer the prospect of more automatic use, not least because the difficult, continuous, part of the transition mechanism can be coupled in a generic way, using a proposal distribution of convenience. One of the methods is based on a neat decomposition of any unimodal (multivariate) symmetric density into pieces that may be re-assembled to construct any translated copy of itself: that allows coupling of a continuum of Metropolis proposals to a finite set, at least for a compact state space. We discuss methods for economically coupling the subsequent accept/reject decisions. Our second new method deals with unbounded state spaces, using a trick due to W. S. Kendall of running a coupled dominating process in parallel with the sample paths of interest. The random subset of the state space below the dominating path is compact, allowing efficient coupling and coalescence. We look towards the possibility that application of such methods could become sufficiently convenient that they could become the basis for routine Bayesian computation in the foreseeable future. ",

We present a strategy for trading between false acceptances and false rejections in the standard model. From one perspective this strategy is exactly optimal, including constants. We apply our results to obtain a good general purpose apple tasting algorithm as well as nearly optimal apple tasting algorithms for a variety of standard classes, such as conjunctions and disjunctions of n boolean variables.

So during learning, it is important to keep the weights simple by penalizing the amount of information they contain. The amount of information in a weight can be controlled by adding Gaussian noise and the noise level can be adapted during learning to optimize the trade-off between the expected squared error of the network and the amount of information in the weights. We describe a method of computing the derivatives of the expected squared error and of the amount of information in the noisy weights in a network that contains a layer of non-linear hidden units. Provided the output units are linear, the exact derivatives can be computed efficiently without time-consuming Monte Carlo simulations. The idea of minimizing the amount of information that is required to communicate the weights of a neural network leads to a number of interesting schemes for encoding the weights.",

Here we consider the problem of learning how to order, given feedback in the form of preference judgments, i.e., statements to the effect that one instance should be ranked ahead of another. We outline a two-stage approach in which one first learns by conventional means a preference function, of the form PREF(u; v), which indicates whether it is advisable to rank u before v. New instances are then ordered so as to maximize agreements with the learned preference function. We show that the problem of finding the ordering that agrees best with a preference function is NP-complete, even under very restrictive assumptions. Nevertheless, we describe a simple greedy algorithm that is guaranteed to find a good approximation. We then discuss an on-line learning algorithm, based on the \"Hedge\" algorithm, for finding a good linear combination of ranking \"experts.\" We use the ordering algorithm combined with the on-line learning algorithm to find a combination of \"search experts,\" each of which is a domain-specific query expansion strategy for a WWW search engine, and present experimental results that demonstrate the merits of our approach.

We present a hybrid neural network solution which compares favorably with other methods. The system combines local image sampling, a self-organizing map neural network, and a convolutional neural network. The self-organizing map provides a quantization of the image samples into a topological space where inputs that are nearby in the original space are also nearby in the output space, thereby providing dimensionality reduction and invariance to minor changes in the image sample, and the convolutional neural network provides for partial invariance to translation, rotation, scale, and deformation. The convolutional network extracts successively larger features in a hierarchical set of layers. We present results using the Karhunen-Loeve transform in place of the self-organizing map, and a multilayer perceptron in place of the convolutional network. The Karhunen-Loeve transform performs almost as well (5.3% error versus 3.8%). The multilayer perceptron performs very poorly (40% error versus 3.8%). The method is capable of rapid classification, requires only fast, approximate normalization and preprocessing, and consistently exhibits better classification performance than the eigenfaces approach (Turk and Pentland, 1991) on the database considered as the number of images per person in the training database is varied from 1 to 5. With 5 images per person the proposed method and eigenfaces result in 3.8% and 10.5% error respectively.

Specifically, the set of initial policy-value function pairs for which our algorithm guarantees convergence is a strict superset of the set for which modified policy iteration converges. This generalization was obtained by making a simple and easily implementable change to the policy evaluation operator used in updating the value function.

Unfortunately, the special characteristics of dynamic probabilistic networks (DPNs), which are used to represent stochastic temporal processes, mean that standard simulation algorithms perform very poorly. In essence, the simulation trials diverge further and further from reality as the process is observed over time. In this paper, we present simulation algorithms that use the evidence observed at each time step to push the set of trials back towards reality. The first algorithm, \"evidence reversal\" (ER) restructures each time slice of the DPN so that the evidence nodes for the slice become ancestors of the state variables. The second algorithm, called \"survival of the fittest\" sampling (SOF), \"repopulates\" the set of trials at each time step using a stochastic reproduction rate weighted by the likelihood of the evidence according to each trial. We compare the performance of each algorithm with likelihood weighting on the original network, and also investigate the benefits of combining the ER and SOF methods. The ER/SOF combination appears to maintain bounded error independent of the number of time steps in the simulation.",

This paper investigates the reasons why small disjuncts are more error prone than large disjuncts. It shows that when there are rare cases within a domain, then factors such as attribute noise, missing attributes, class noise and training set size can result in small disjuncts being more error prone than large disjuncts and in rare cases being more error prone than common cases. This paper also assesses the impact that these error prone small disjuncts and rare cases have on inductive learning (i.e., on error rate). One key conclusion is that when low levels of attribute noise are applied only to the training set (the ability to learn the correct concept is being evaluated), rare cases within a domain are primarily responsible for making learning difficult.",

    "text": "Title: Asking Questions to Minimize Errors  \nAbstract: A number of efficient learning algorithms achieve exact identification of an unknown function from some class using membership and equivalence queries. Using a standard transformation such algorithms can easily be converted to on-line learning algorithms that use membership queries. Under such a transformation the number of equivalence queries made by the query algorithm directly corresponds to the number of mistakes made by the on-line algorithm. In this paper we consider several of the natural classes known to be learnable in this setting, and investigate the minimum number of equivalence queries with accompanying counterexamples (or equivalently the minimum number of mistakes in the on-line model) that can be made by a learning algorithm that makes a polynomial number of membership queries and uses polynomial computation time. We are able both to reduce the number of equivalence queries used by the previous algorithms and often to prove matching lower bounds. As an example, consider the class of DNF formulas over n variables with at most k = O(log n) terms. Previously, the algorithm of Blum and Rudich [BR92] provided the best known upper bound of 2 O(k) log n for the minimum number of equivalence queries needed for exact identification. We greatly improve on this upper bound showing that exactly k counterexamples are needed if the learner knows k a priori and exactly k +1 counterexamples are needed if the learner does not know k a priori. This exactly matches known lower bounds [BC92]. For many of our results we obtain a complete characterization of the tradeoff between the number of membership and equivalence queries needed for exact identification. The classes we consider here are monotone DNF formulas, Horn sentences, O(log n)-term DNF formulas, read-k sat-j DNF formulas, read-once formulas over various bases, and deterministic finite automata.

Using \"cached\" cases brings additional costs with it due to retrieval time, case adaptation time and also storage space. Simply storing all cases will result in a situation in which retrieving and trying to adapt old cases will take more time (on average) than not caching at all. This means that caching must be applied selectively to build a case memory that is actually useful. This is a form of the utility problem [4, 2]. The approach taken here is to construct a \"cost model\" of a system that can be used to predict the effect of changes to the system. In this paper we describe the utility problem associated with \"caching\" cases and the construction of a \"cost model\".

We thank John Clement for the use of his protocol transcript, James Greeno for his contribution to developing our constructive modeling interpretation of it, and Ryan Tweney for his helpful comments Todd W. Griffith, Nancy J. Nersessian, and Ashok Goel Abstract We hypothesize generic models to be central in conceptual change in science. This hypothesis has its origins in two theoretical sources. The first source, constructive modeling, derives from a philosophical theory that synthesizes analyses of historical conceptual changes in science with investigations of reasoning and representation in cognitive psychology. The theory of constructive modeling posits generic mental models as productive in conceptual change. The second source, adaptive modeling, derives from a computational theory of creative design. Both theories posit situation independent domain abstractions, i.e. generic models. Using a constructive modeling interpretation of the reasoning exhibited in protocols collected by John Clement (1989) of a problem solving session involving conceptual change, we employ the resources of the theory of adaptive modeling to develop a new computational model, ToRQUE. Here we describe a piece of our analysis of the protocol to illustrate how our synthesis of the two theories is being used to develop a system for articulating and testing ToRQUE. The results of our research show how generic modeling plays a central role in conceptual change. They also demonstrate how such an interdisciplinary synthesis can provide significant insights into scientific reasoning. ",

As a result, systems may select cases that are difficult or impossible for them to adapt, even when easily adaptable cases are available in memory.

Because hand coding this knowledge accounts for a large part of the knowledge acquisition burden for developing CBR systems, it is appealing to acquire it by learning, and CBR is a promising learning method to apply. This observation suggests developing case-based CBR systems, CBR systems whose components themselves use CBR. However, despite early interest in case-based approaches to CBR, this method has received comparatively little attention. Open questions include how case-based components of a CBR system should be designed, the amount of knowledge acquisition effort they require, and their effectiveness. This paper investigates these questions through a case study of issues addressed, methods used, and results achieved by a case-based planning system that uses CBR to guide its case adaptation and similarity assessment. The paper discusses design considerations and presents empirical results that support the usefulness of case-based CBR, that point to potential problems and tradeoffs, and that directly demonstrate the overlapping roles of different CBR knowledge sources.

Planning performance improves with the accumulation and reuse of a library of planning cases. Retrieval is driven by domain-dependent similarity metrics based on planning goals and scenarios. In complex situations with multiple goals, retrieval may find multiple past planning cases that are jointly similar to the new planning situation. This paper presents the issues and implications involved in the replay of multiple planning cases, as opposed to a single one. Multiple case plan replay involves the adaptation and merging of the annotated derivations of the planning cases. Several merge strategies for replay are introduced that can process with various forms of eagerness the differences between the past and new situations and the annotated justifications at the planning cases. In particular, we introduce an effective merging strategy that considers plan step choices especially appropriate for the interleaving of planning and plan execution. We illustrate and discuss the effectiveness of the merging strategies in specific domains.",

The work centers on the principled reuse and modification of past plans by exploiting their justification structure. The goal is to record as much as possible of the rationale underlying each planning decision in a mixed-initiative framework where human and machine planners interact. This rationale is used to determine which past plans are relevant to a new situation, to focus user's modification and replanning on different relevant steps when external circumstances dictate, and to ensure consistency in multi-user distributed scenarios. We build upon our previous work in Prodigy/Analogy, which incorporates algorithms to capture and reuse the rationale of an automated planner during its plan generation. To support a mixed-initiative environment, we have developed user interactive capabilities in the Prodigy planning and learning system. We are also working towards the integration of the rationale-supported plan reuse in Prodigy/Analogy with the plan retrieval and modification tools of ForMAT. Finally, we have focused on the user's input into the process of plan reuse, in particular when conditional planning is needed. ",

To assist the often non-initiated users, it is desirable that this model selection process be automated. Using experience from base level learning, researchers have proposed meta-learning as a possible solution. Historically, predictive accuracy has been the de facto criterion, with most work in meta-learning focusing on the discovery of rules that match applications to models based on accuracy only. Although predictive accuracy is clearly an important criterion, it is also the case that there are a number of other criteria that could, and often ought to, be considered when learning about model selection. This paper presents a number of such criteria and discusses the impact they have on meta-level approaches to model selection.",

This adaptive EA is general, using no domain specific knowledge, except, of course, from the decoder (fitness function). We compare this adaptive EA to a powerful traditional graph coloring technique DSatur and the Grouping GA on a wide range of problem instances with different size, topology and edge density.

Some of the learning rules can be used to estimate an independent component which has a negative kurtosis, and the others estimate a component of positive kurtosis. Next, a two-unit system is introduced to estimate an independent component of any kurtosis. The results are then generalized to estimate independent components from non-sphered (raw) mixtures. To separate several independent components, a system of several neurons with linear negative feedback is used. The convergence of the learning rules is rigorously proven without any unnecessary hypotheses on the distributions of the independent components.",

The approximation rate captures the complexity of the target function with respect to the hypothesis model, and the estimation rate captures the extent to which the hypothesis model suffers from overfitting. Using these two measures, we give a rigorous and general bound on the error of cross validation. The bound clearly shows the tradeoffs involved with making fl the fraction of data saved for testing too large or too small. By optimizing the bound with respect to fl, we then argue (through a combination of formal analysis, plotting, and controlled experimentation) that the following qualitative properties of cross validation behavior should be quite robust to significant changes in the underlying model selection problem: ",

Efficient stochastic source coding and an application to a Bayesian network source model. The Computer Journal 40, 157-165. In this paper, we introduce a new algorithm called \"bits-back coding\" that makes stochastic source codes efficient. For a given one-to-many source code, we show that this algorithm can actually be more efficient than the algorithm that always picks the shortest codeword. Optimal efficiency is achieved when codewords are chosen according to the Boltzmann distribution based on the codeword lengths. It turns out that a commonly used technique for determining parameters | maximum likelihood estimation | actually minimizes the bits-back coding cost when codewords are chosen according to the Boltzmann distribution. A tractable approximation to maximum likelihood estimation | the generalized expectation maximization algorithm | minimizes the bits-back coding cost. After presenting a binary Bayesian network model that assigns exponentially many codewords to each symbol, we show how a tractable approximation to the Boltzmann distribution can be used for bits-back coding. We illustrate the performance of bits-back coding using using nonsynthetic data with a binary Bayesian network source model that produces 2 60 possible codewords for each input symbol. The rate for bits-back coding is nearly one half of that obtained by picking the shortest codeword for each symbol. ",

These simple algorithms belong to the multiplicative weights family of algorithms. The performance of these algorithms degrades only logarithmically with the number of experts, making them particularly useful in applications where the number of experts is very large. However, in applications such as text categorization, it is often natural for some of the experts to abstain from making predictions on some of the instances. We show how to transform algorithms that assume that all experts are always awake to algorithms that do not require this assumption. We also show how to derive corresponding loss bounds. Our method is very general, and can be applied to a large family of online learning algorithms. We also give applications to various prediction models including decision graphs and switching experts.

    "text": "Title: Naive Bayesian classifier within ILP-R  \nAbstract: When dealing with the classification problems, current ILP systems often lag behind state-of-the-art attributional learners. Part of the blame can be ascribed to a much larger hypothesis space which, therefore, cannot be as thoroughly explored. However, sometimes it is due to the fact that ILP systems do not take into account the probabilistic aspects of hypotheses when classifying unseen examples. This paper proposes just that. We developed a naive Bayesian classifier within our ILP-R first order learner. The learner itself uses a clever RELIEF based heuristic which is able to detect strong dependencies within the literal space when such dependencies exist. We conducted a series of experiments on artificial and real-world data sets. The results show that the combination of ILP-R together with the naive Bayesian classifier sometimes significantly improves the classification of unseen instances as measured by both classification accuracy and average information score.",

Both flat memory and inductive approaches suffer from serious drawbacks. In the first approach, the search time increases when dealing with large scale memory base, while in the second one the modification of the case memory becomes very complex because of its sophisticated architecture. In this paper, we show how we construct a simple efficient indexing system structure. The idea is to construct a case hierarchy with two levels of memory: the lower level contains cases organised into groups of similar cases, while the upper level contains prototypes. each prototype represents one group of cases. This smaller memory is used during the retrieval phase. Prototype construction is achieved by means of an incremental prototype-based NN (Neural Network).

Each instance is a configuration of n points on the real line, where it is labeled according to whether or not it visually resembles the target pattern. To capture the notion of visual resemblance we use the Hausdorff metric.

Their dynamic nature allows them to capture the time course of cognitive processing, and their learned weights may often be easily interpreted as soft constraints between representational components. Perhaps the most significant feature of such networks, however, is their ability to facilitate generalization by enforcing well formedness constraints on intermediate and output representations. Attractor networks which learn the systematic regularities of well formed representations by exposure to a small number of examples are said to possess articulated attractors. This paper investigates the conditions under which articulated attractors arise in recurrent networks trained using variants of backpropagation. The results of computational experiments demonstrate that such structured attrac-tors can spontaneously appear in an emergence of systematic-ity, if an appropriate error signal is presented directly to the recurrent processing elements. We show, however, that distal error signals, backpropagated through intervening weights, pose serious problems for networks of this kind. We present simulation results, discuss the reasons for this difficulty, and suggest some directions for future attempts to surmount it. ",

The idea is to subsample the continuous chain at renewal times related to small sets which control the discretization. Once a finite Markov chain is derived from the MCMC output, general convergence properties on finite state spaces can be exploited for convergence assessment in several directions. Our choice is based on a divergence criterion derived from Kemeny and Snell (1960), which is first evaluated on parallel chains with a stopping time, and then implemented, more efficiently, on two parallel chains only, using Birkhoff's pointwise ergodic theorem for stopping rules. The performance of this criterion is illustrated on three standard examples. ",

The classification performance of the resulting decision tree on unseen testing data is used as the fitness of the underlying feature subset.

Thus far, PAC learning has mostly been used to analyze syntactic bias, such as limiting concepts to conjunctions of boolean prepositions. This paper demonstrates that PAC learning can also be used to analyze semantic bias, such as a domain theory about the concept being learned. The key idea is to view the hypothesis space in PAC learning as that consistent with all prior knowledge, syntactic and semantic. In particular, the paper presents a PAC analysis of determinations, a type of relevance knowledge. The results of the analysis reveal crisp distinctions and relations among different determinations, and illustrate the usefulness of an analysis based on the PAC model. ",

This paper presents an algorithm that uses a set of observations to learn a credulous version of this default theory that is (essentially) \"optimally accurate\". In more detail, we can associate a given default theory with a set of related credulous theories R = fR i g, where each R i uses its own total ordering of the defaults to determine which single answer to return for each query. Our goal is to select the credulous theory that has the highest \"expected accuracy\", where each R i 's expected accuracy is the probability that the answer it produces to a query will correspond correctly to the world. Unfortunately, a theory's expected accuracy depends on the distribution of queries, which is usually not known. Moreover, the task of identifying the optimal R opt 2 R, even given that distribution information, is intractable. This paper presents a method, OptAcc, that sidesteps these problems by using a set of samples to estimate the unknown distribution, and by hill-climbing to a local optimum. In particular, given any parameters *; ffi &gt; 0, OptAcc produces an R oa 2 R whose expected accuracy is, with probability at least 1 ffi, within * of a local optimum.

The experiments for both the human subjects and neural networks make use of interpolations of facial expressions from the Pictures of Facial Affect Database [Ekman and Friesen, 1976]. The only difference in materials between those used in the human subjects experiments [Young et al., 1997] and our materials are the manner in which the interpolated images are constructed - image-quality morphs versus pixel averages. Nevertheless, the neural network accurately captures the categorical nature of the human responses, showing sharp transitions in labeling of images along the interpolated sequence. Crucially for a demonstration of categorical perception [Harnad, 1987], the model shows the highest discrimination between transition images at the crossover point. The model also captures the shape of the reaction time curves of the human subjects along the sequences. Finally, the network matches human subjects' judgements of which expressions are being mixed in the images. The main failing of the model is that there are intrusions of neutral responses in some transitions, which are not seen in the human subjects. We attribute this difference to the difference between the pixel average stimuli and the image quality morph stimuli. These results show that a simple neural network classifier, with no access to the biological constraints that are presumably imposed on the human emotion processor, and whose only access to the surrounding culture is the category labels placed by American subjects on the facial expressions, can nevertheless simulate fairly well the human responses to emotional expressions.

Dynamic Bayesian networks provide a compact representation for stochastic processes. Unfortunately, they are often unwieldy since they cannot explicitly model the complex organizational structure of many real life systems: the fact that processes are typically composed of several interacting subprocesses, each of which can, in turn, be further decomposed. We propose a hierarchically structured representation language which extends both dynamic Bayesian networks and the object-oriented Bayesian network framework of [9], and show that our language allows us to describe such systems in a natural and modular way. Our language supports a natural representation for certain system characteristics that are hard to capture using more traditional frameworks. For example, it allows us to represent systems where some processes evolve at a different rate than others, or systems where the processes interact only intermittently. We provide a simple inference mechanism for our representation via translation to Bayesian networks, and suggest ways in which the inference algorithm can exploit the additional structure encoded in our representation.

One key problem is how to assign weights to attributes of cases. Although several weighting methods have been proposed, some methods cannot handle numeric attributes directly, so it is necessary to discretize numeric values by classification. Furthermore, existing methods have no theoretical background, so little can be said about optimality. We propose a new weighting method based on a statistical technique called Quantification Method II. It can handle both numeric and symbolic attributes in the same framework. Generated attribute weights are optimal in the sense that they maximize the ratio of variance between classes to variance of all cases. Experiments on several benchmark tests show that in many cases, our method obtains higher accuracies than some other weighting methods. The results also indicate that it can distinguish relevant attributes from irrelevant ones, and can tolerate noisy data. ",

Empirical results show that, while best result are obtained when the training model closely matches the target environment, using a training environment that is more noisy than the target environment is better than using using a training environment that has less noise than the target environment.

The flexible representation scheme is very important because it allows the underlying structure of the data to be discovered automatically. One primary difficulty, however, is that the solutions may grow too big without any improvement of their generalization ability. In this paper we investigate the fundamental relationship between the performance and complexity of the evolved structures. The essence of the parsimony problem is demonstrated empirically by analyzing error landscapes of programs evolved for neural network synthesis. We consider genetic programming as a statistical inference problem and apply the Bayesian model-comparison framework to introduce a class of fitness functions with error and complexity terms. An adaptive learning method is then presented that automatically balances the model-complexity factor to evolve parsimonious programs without losing the diversity of the population needed for achieving the desired training accuracy. The effectiveness of this approach is empirically shown on the induction of sigma-pi neural networks for solving a real-world medical diagnosis problem as well as benchmark tasks. ",

This is particularly difficult in case-based reasoning systems because such systems are typically very complex, as are the tasks and domains in which they operate. We present a methodology for the evaluation of case-based reasoning systems through systematic empirical experimentation over a range of system configurations and environmental conditions, coupled with rigorous statistical analysis of the results of the experiments. This methodology enables us to understand the behavior of the system in terms of the theory and design of the computational model, to select the best system configuration for a given domain, and to predict how the system will behave in response to changing domain and problem characteristics. A case study of a mul-tistrategy case-based and reinforcement learning system which performs autonomous robotic navigation is presented as an example. ",

As well as providing an intuitively appealing representation at the modelling stage, this reparameterisation has important bearing on both the prior distribution and the performance of MCMC algorithms. We compare two possible reparameterisations extending Mengersen and Robert (1996) and show that the reparameterisation which does not link the secondary components together is associated with poor convergence properties of MCMC algorithms.

However, this ignores model uncertainty, which can be substantial. We review the standard Bayesian model averaging solution to this problem and extend it to survival analysis, introducing partial Bayes factors to do so for the Cox proportional hazards model.

    "text": "Title: A Model-Based Approach for Supporting Dialogue Inferencing in a Conversational Case-Based Reasoner  \nAbstract: Conversational case-based reasoning (CCBR) is a form of interactive case-based reasoning where users input a partial problem description (in text). The CCBR system responds with a ranked solution display, which lists the solutions of stored cases whose problem descriptions best match the user's, and a ranked question display, which lists the unanswered questions in these cases. Users interact with these displays, either refining their problem description by answering selected questions, or selecting a solution to apply. CCBR systems should support dialogue inferencing; they should infer answers to questions that are implied by the problem description. Otherwise, questions will be listed that the user believes they have already answered. The standard approach to dialogue inferencing allows case library designers to insert rules that define implications between the problem description and unanswered questions. However, this approach imposes substantial knowledge engineering requirements. We introduce an alternative approach whereby an intelligent assistant guides the designer in defining a model of their case library, from which implication rules are derived. We detail this approach, its benefits, and explain how it can be supported through an integration with Parka-DB, a fast relational database system. We will evaluate our approach in the context of our CCBR system, named NaCoDAE. This paper appeared at the 1998 AAAI Spring Symposium on Multimodal Reasoning, and is NCARAI TR AIC-97-023. We introduce an integrated reasoning approach in which a model-based reasoning component performs an important inferencing role in a conversational case-based reasoning (CCBR) system named NaCoDAE (Breslow & Aha, 1997) (Figure 1).

Because the search space of clausal theories is larger than that of attribute value representation, claudien also accepts as input a declarative specification of the language bias, which determines the set of syntactically well-formed regularities. Whereas other papers on claudien focuss on the semantics or logical problem specification of claudien, on the discovery algorithm, or the PAC-learning aspects, this paper wants to illustrate the power of the resulting technique. In order to achieve this aim, we show how claudien can be used to learn 1) integrity constraints in databases, 2) functional dependencies and determinations, 3) properties of sequences, 4) mixed quantitative and qualitative laws, 5) reverse engineering, and 6) classification rules.

Greedy search prevents current inductive machine learning algorithms to detect significant dependencies between the attributes. Recently, Kira and Rendell developed the RELIEF algorithm for estimating the quality of attributes that is able to detect dependencies between attributes. We show strong relation between RELIEF's estimates and impurity functions, that are usually used for heuristic guidance of inductive learning algorithms. We propose to use RELIEFF, an extended version of RELIEF, instead of myopic impurity functions. We have reimplemented Assistant, a system for top down induction of decision trees, using RELIEFF as an estimator of attributes at each selection step. The algorithm is tested on several artificial and several real world problems.

An interesting characteristic of adaptive search techniques is their ability to perform well in many problem domains while failing in others. Because of Genetic Programming's flexible tree structure, any particular problem can be represented in myriad forms. These representations have variegated effects on search performance. Therefore, an aspect of fundamental engineering significance is to find a representation which, when acted upon by Genetic Programming operators, optimizes search performance. We discover, in the case of chaotic time series prediction, that the representation commonly used in this domain does not yield optimal solutions. Instead, we find that the population converges onto one \"accurately replicating\" tree before other trees can be explored. To correct for this premature convergence we make a simple modification to the crossover operator. In this paper we review previous work with GP time series prediction, pointing out an anomalous result related to overlearning, and report the improvement effected by our modified crossover operator.

At each step, in our ILP-R system, this heuristic is used to determine a beam of candidate literals. The beam is then used in an exhaustive search for a potentially good conjunction of literals. From the efficiency point of view we introduce interesting declarative bias which enables us to keep the growth of the training set, when introducing new variables, within linear bounds (linear with respect to the clause length). This bias prohibits cross-referencing of variables in variable dependency tree. The resulting system has been tested on various artificial problems.

If (A; B) is a reachable pair and (A; C) is an observable pair, then is minimal in the sense that any other sign-linear system with the same input/output behavior has dimension at least n. But, if n 1 &lt; n, then det A = 0 and is not observable and hence not canonical. Let us find another system ~ (necessarily not sign-linear) which has the same input/output behavior as , but is canonical. Let i be the relative degree of the ith row of the Markov sequence A, and = minf i : i = 1; : : : ; pg. Let the initial state be x.

We investigate the potential benefits of using a given hierarchy over base classes to learn accurate multi-category classifiers for these domains. First, we consider the possibility of exploiting a class hierarchy as prior knowledge that can help one learn a more accurate classifier. We explore the benefits of learning category-discriminants in a hard top-down fashion and compare this to a soft approach which shares training data among sibling categories. In doing so, we verify that hierarchies have the potential to improve prediction accuracy. But we argue that the reasons for this can be subtle. Sometimes, the improvement is only because using a hierarchy happens to constrain the expressiveness of a hypothesis class in an appropriate manner. However, various controlled experiments show that in other cases the performance advantage associated with using a hierarchy really does seem to be due to the prior knowledge it encodes. ",

Predicting nearly as well as the best pruning of a decision tree  \nAbstract: Many algorithms for inferring a decision tree from data involve a two-phase process: First, a very large decision tree is grown which typically ends up \"over-fitting\" the data. To reduce over-fitting, in the second phase, the tree is pruned using one of a number of available methods. The final tree is then output and used for classification on test data. In this paper, we suggest an alternative approach to the pruning phase. Using a given unpruned decision tree, we present a new method of making predictions on test data, and we prove that our algorithm's performance will not be \"much worse\" (in a precise technical sense) than the predictions made by the best reasonably small pruning of the given decision tree. Thus, our procedure is guaranteed to be competitive (in terms of the quality of its predictions) with any pruning algorithm. We prove that our procedure is very efficient and highly robust. Our method can be viewed as a synthesis of two previously studied techniques. First, we apply Cesa-Bianchi et al.'s [4] results on predicting using \"expert advice\" (where we view each pruning as an \"expert\") to obtain an algorithm that has provably low prediction loss, but that is com-putationally infeasible. Next, we generalize and apply a method developed by Buntine [3], [2] and Willems, Shtarkov and Tjalkens [20], [21] to derive a very efficient implementation of this procedure. ",

One of the main advantages of the probabilistic approach we describe here is our ability to perform detailed experiments where we can experiment with different models. We can easily perform local substitutions (mutations) and measure (probabilistically) their effect on the global structure. Window-based methods do not support such experimentation as readily. Our method is efficient both during training and during prediction, which is important in order to be able to perform many experiments with different networks. We believe that probabilistic methods are comparable to other methods in prediction quality. In addition, the predictions generated by our methods have precise quantitative semantics which is not shared by other classification methods. Specifically, all the causal and statistical independence assumptions are made explicit in our networks thereby allowing biologists to study and experiment with different causal models in a convenient manner.

The name sanity-check refers to the fact that although we often expect the leave-one-out estimate to perform considerably better than the training error estimate, we are here only seeking assurance that its performance will not be considerably worse. Perhaps surprisingly, such assurance has been given only for rather limited cases in the prior literature on cross-validation. Any nontrivial bound on the error of leave-one-out must rely on some notion of algorithmic stability. Previous bounds relied on the rather strong notion of hypothesis stability, whose application was primarily limited to nearest-neighbor and other local algorithms. Here we introduce the new and weaker notion of error stability, and apply it to obtain sanity-check bounds for leave-one-out for other classes of learning algorithms, including training error minimization procedures and Bayesian algorithms. We also provide lower bounds demonstrating the necessity of error stability for proving bounds on the error of the leave-one-out estimate, and the fact that for training error minimization algorithms, in the worst case such bounds must still depend on the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension of the hypothesis class.

Both species are implemented as simulated mobile robots (Kheperas) with infrared proximity sensors, but the predator has an additional vision module whereas the prey has a maximum speed set to twice that of the predator. Different types of variability during life for neurocontrollers with the same architecture and genetic length are compared.

The internal direction represented by these cells uses both self-motion information for inertially based updating and familiar visual landmarks for calibration. Here, a model of the dynamics of the HD cell ensemble is presented. The stability of a localized static activity profile in the network and a dynamic shift mechanism are explained naturally by synaptic weight distribution components with even and odd symmetry, respectively. Under symmetric weights or symmetric reciprocal connections, a stable activity profile close to the known directional tuning curves will emerge. By adding a slight asymmetry to the weights, the activity profile will shift continuously without disturbances to its shape, and the shift speed can be accurately controlled by the strength of the odd-weight component. The generic formulation of the shift mechanism is determined uniquely within the current theoretical framework. The attractor dynamics of the system ensures modality-independence of the internal representation and facilitates the correction for cumulative error by the putative local-view detectors. The model offers a specific one-dimensional example of a computational mechanism in which a truly world-centered representation can be derived from observer-centered sensory inputs by integrating self-motion information.

In this article, we describe neural-network learning algorithms that are able to produce comprehensible models, and that do not require excessive training times. Specifically, we discuss two classes of approaches for data mining with neural networks. The first type of approach, often called rule extraction, involves extracting symbolic models from trained neural networks. The second approach is to directly learn simple, easy-to-understand networks. We argue that, given the current state of the art, neural-network methods deserve a place in the tool boxes of data-mining specialists. ",

The feature selection problem considered is that of discriminating between two sets while recognizing irrelevant and redundant features and suppressing them. This creates a lean model that often generalizes better to new unseen data. Computational results on real data confirm improved generalization of leaner models. Clustering is exemplified by the unsupervised learning of patterns and clusters that may exist in a given database and is a useful tool for knowledge discovery in databases (KDD). A mathematical programming formulation of this problem is proposed that is theoretically justifiable and computationally implementable in a finite number of steps. A resulting k-Median Algorithm is utilized to discover very useful survival curves for breast cancer patients from a medical database. Robust representation is concerned with minimizing trained model degradation when applied to new problems. A novel approach is proposed that purposely tolerates a small error in the training process in order to avoid overfitting data that may contain errors.

The hypothesis language determines the search space. In standard inductive learning algorithms, the structure of the search space is determined by generalization/specialization operators. Algorithms perform locally optimal search by using a hill-climbing and/or a beam-search strategy. To overcome this limitation, concept learning can be viewed as stochastic search of the space of concept descriptions. The proposed stochastic search method is based on simulated annealing which is known as a successful means for solving combinatorial optimization problems. The stochastic search method, implemented in a rule learning system ATRIS, is based on a compact and efficient representation of the problem and the appropriate operators for structuring the search space. Furthermore, by heuristic pruning of the search space, the method enables also handling of imperfect data. The paper introduces the stochastic search method, describes the ATRIS learning algorithm and gives results of the experiments. ",

The first approach incrementally marginalizes nodes that contribute to the ambiguous qualitative relationships. The second approach evaluates approximate Bayesian networks for bounds of probability distributions, and uses these bounds to determinate qualitative relationships in question. This approach is also incremental in that the algorithm refines the state spaces of random variables for tighter bounds until the qualitative relationships are resolved. Both approaches provide systematic methods for tradeoff resolution at potentially lower computational cost than application of purely numeric methods. ",

A previously proposed solution to this problem is to apply program transformation in order to obtain non-recursive target predicates from recursive ones. However, the application of this method prevents recursive specializations from being found. In this work, we present the algorithm spectre ii which is not limited to specializing non-recursive predicates. The key idea upon which the algorithm is based is that it is not enough to specialize or remove clauses in refutations of negative examples in order to obtain correct specializations, but it is sometimes necessary to specialize clauses that appear only in refutations of positive examples. In contrast to its predecessor spectre, the new algorithm is not limited to specializing clauses defining one predicate only, but may specialize clauses defining multiple predicates. Furthermore, the positive and negative examples are no longer required to be instances of the same predicate. It is proven that the algorithm produces a correct specialization when all positive examples are logical consequences of the original program, there is a finite number of derivations of positive and negative examples and when no positive and negative examples have the same sequence of input clauses in their refutations.",

The input to the algorithm is, besides a logic program and positive and negative examples, a computation rule, which determines the shape of the SLD-tree that is to be pruned. It is shown that the generality of the resulting specialization is dependent on the computation rule, and experimental results are presented from using three different computation rules. The experiments indicate that the computation rule should be formulated so that the number of applications of unfolding is kept as low as possible. The algorithm, which uses a divide-and-conquer method, is also compared with a covering algorithm.

    "text": "Title: Plasticity in cortical neuron properties: Modeling the effects of an NMDA antagonist and a GABA\nAbstract: Infusion of a GABA agonist (Reiter & Stryker, 1988) and infusion of an NMDA receptor antagonist (Bear et al., 1990), in the primary visual cortex of kittens during monocular deprivation, shifts ocular dominance toward the closed eye, in the cortical region near the infusion site. This reverse ocular dominance shift has been previously modeled by variants of a covariance synaptic plasticity rule (Bear et al., 1990; Clothiaux et al., 1991; Miller et al., 1989; Reiter & Stryker, 1988). Kasamatsu et al. (1997, 1998) showed that infusion of an NMDA receptor antagonist in adult cat primary visual cortex changes ocular dominance distribution, reduces binocularity, and reduces orientation and direction selectivity. This paper presents a novel account of the effects of these pharmacological treatments, based on the EXIN synaptic plasticity rules (Marshall, 1995), which include both an instar afferent excitatory and an outstar lateral inhibitory rule. Functionally, the EXIN plasticity rules enhance the efficiency, discrimination, and context-sensitivity of a neural network's representation of perceptual patterns (Marshall, 1995; Marshall & Gupta, 1998). The EXIN model decreases lateral inhibition from neurons outside the infusion site (control regions) to neurons inside the infusion region, during monocular deprivation. In the model, plasticity in afferent pathways to neurons affected by the pharmacological treatments is assumed to be blocked , as opposed to previous models (Bear et al., 1990; Miller et al., 1989; Reiter & Stryker, 1988), in which afferent pathways from the open eye to neurons in the infusion region are weakened . The proposed model is consistent with results suggesting that long-term plasticity can be blocked by NMDA antagonists or by postsynaptic hyperpolarization (Bear et al., 1990; Dudek & Bear, 1992; Goda & Stevens, 1996; Kirkwood et al., 1993). Since the role of plasticity in lateral inhibitory pathways in producing cortical plasticity has not received much attention, several predictions are made based on the EXIN lateral inhibitory plasticity rule.

The first algorithm receives at most sd counterexamples and uses time and membership queries polynomial in s and log n for d any constant. Further, all equivalence queries made can be formulated as the union of O(sd log s) axis-parallel boxes. Next, we introduce a new complexity measure that better captures the complexity of a union of boxes than simply the number of boxes and dimensions. Our new measure, , is the number of segments in the target polyhedron where a segment is a maximum portion of one of the sides of the polyhedron that lies entirely inside or entirely outside each of the other halfspaces defining the polyhedron. We then present an improvement of our first algorithm that uses time and queries polynomial in and log n. The hypothesis class used here is decision trees of height at most 2sd. Further we can show that the time and queries used by this algorithm are polynomial in d and log n for s any constant thus generalizing the exact learnability of DNF formulas with a constant number of terms. In fact, this single algorithm is efficient for either s or d constant. ",

These two approaches are similar in that they both make certain independence assumptions about the data. However, whereas MBR uses specific cases to perform classification, Bayesian methods summarize the data probabilistically. We demonstrate that a particular MBR system called Pebls works comparatively well on a wide range of domains using both real and artificial data. With respect to the artificial data, we consider distributions where the concept classes are separated by functional discriminants, as well as time-series data generated by Markov models of varying complexity. Finally, we show formally that Pebls can learn (in the limit) natural concept classes that the Bayesian classifier cannot learn, and that it will attain perfect accuracy whenever ",

The metric chosen to deflne this distance can strongly efiect performance. An optimal choice depends on the problem at hand as characterized by the respective class distributions on the input measurement space, and within a given problem, on the location of the unknown object in that space. In this paper new types of K-nearest-neighbor procedures are described that estimate the local relevance of each input variable, or their linear combinations, for each individual point to be classifled. This information is then used to separately customize the metric used to deflne distance from that object in flnding its nearest neighbors.

The method requires no algorithm parameter adjustment by the user. The results of extensive experimentation indicate that lprune is often superior to autoprune (which is superior to OBD) on diagnosis tasks unless severe pruning early in the training process is required.

    "text": "Title: Constructive Similarity Assessment: Using Stored Cases to Define New Situations  \nAbstract: A fundamental issue in case-based reasoning is similarity assessment: determining similarities and differences between new and retrieved cases. Many methods have been developed for comparing input case descriptions to the cases already in memory. However, the success of such methods depends on the input case description being sufficiently complete to reflect the important features of the new situation, which is not assured. In case-based explanation of anomalous events during story understanding, the anomaly arises because the current situation is incompletely understood; consequently, similarity assessment based on matches between known current features and old cases is likely to fail because of gaps in the current case's description. Our solution to the problem of gaps in a new case's description is an approach that we call constructive similarity assessment. Constructive similarity assessment treats similarity assessment not as a simple comparison between fixed new and old cases, but as a process for deciding which types of features should be investigated in the new situation and, if the features are borne out by other knowledge, added to the description of the current case. Constructive similarity assessment does not merely compare new cases to old: using prior cases as its guide, it dynamically carves augmented descriptions of new cases out of memory. ",

However, making such cross-domain analogies is hard and often requires abstractions common to the source and target domains. Recent work in case-based design suggests that generic mechanisms are one type of abstractions used by designers. However, one important yet unexplored issue is where these generic mechanisms come from. We hypothesize that they are acquired incrementally from problem-solving experiences in familiar domains by generalization over patterns of regularity. Three important issues in generalization from experiences are what to generalize from an experience, how far to generalize, and what methods to use. In this paper, we show that mental models in a familiar domain provide the content, and together with the problem-solving context in which learning occurs, also provide the constraints for learning generic mechanisms from design experiences. In particular, we show how the model-based learning method integrated with similarity-based learning addresses the issues in generalization from experiences. ",

A mutation rate schedule that is optimal with respect to the success probability of mutation is presented for each of the objective functions, and it turns out that the standard binary code can hamper the search process even in case of unimodal objective functions. While normally a mutation rate of 1=l (where l denotes the bit string length) is recommendable, our results indicate that a variation of the mutation rate is useful in cases where the fitness function is a multimodal pseudo-boolean function, where multimodality may be caused by the objective function as well as the encoding mechanism.",

The derivations of these algorithms have used different approaches in calculating the gradients, and in this note, we present a short, but unifying account of how these different algorithms compare for the FIR case, both in derivation, and performance. New algorithms are subsequently presented. Simulation results have been performed to benchmark these algorithms.

To achieve this aim we consider a hyper inverse Wishart prior distribution on the concentration matrix for each given graph. To ensure compatibility across models, such prior distributions are obtained by marginalisation from the prior conditional on the complete graph. We explore alternative structures for the hyperparameters of the latter, and their consequences for the model. Model determination is carried out by implementing a reversible jump MCMC sampler. In particular, the dimension-changing move we propose involves adding or dropping an edge from the graph. We characterise the set of moves which preserve the decomposability of the graph, giving a fast algorithm for maintaining the junction tree representation of the graph at each sweep. As state variable, we propose to use the incomplete variance-covariance matrix, containing only the elements for which the corresponding element of the inverse is nonzero. This allows all computations to be performed locally, at the clique level, which is a clear advantage for the analysis of large and complex data-sets. Finally, the statistical and computational performance of the procedure is illustrated by means of both artificial and real multidimensional data-sets. ",

Convergence Properties of Backpropagation  \nAbstract: Technical Report UMIACS-TR-96-22 and CS-TR-3617 Institute for Advanced Computer Studies University of Maryland College Park, MD 20742 Abstract One of the most important aspects of any machine learning paradigm is how it scales according to problem size and complexity. Using a task with known optimal training error, and a pre-specified maximum number of training updates, we investigate the convergence of the backpropagation algorithm with respect to a) the complexity of the required function approximation, b) the size of the network in relation to the size required for an optimal solution, and c) the degree of noise in the training data. In general, for a) the solution found is worse when the function to be approximated is more complex, for b) oversized networks can result in lower training and generalization error in certain cases, and for c) the use of committee or ensemble techniques can be more beneficial as the level of noise in the training data is increased. For the experiments we performed, we do not obtain the optimal solution in any case. We further support the observation that larger networks can produce better training and generalization error using a face recognition example where a network with many more parameters than training points generalizes better than smaller networks.

Two of the most important aspects of machine learning models are how well the model generalizes to unseen data, and how well the model scales with problem complexity. Using a controlled task with known optimal training error, we investigate the convergence of the backpropagation (BP) algorithm. We find that the optimal solution is typically not found. Furthermore, we observe that networks larger than might be expected can result in lower training and generalization error. This result is supported by another real world example. We further investigate the training behavior by analyzing the weights in trained networks (excess degrees of freedom are seen to do little harm and to aid convergence), and contrasting the interpolation characteristics of multi-layer perceptron neural networks (MLPs) and polynomial models (overfitting behavior is very different the MLP is often biased towards smoother solutions). Finally, we analyze relevant theory outlining the reasons for significant practical differences. These results bring into question common beliefs about neural network training regarding convergence and optimal network size, suggest alternate guidelines for practical use (lower fear of excess degrees of freedom), and help to direct future work (e.g. methods for creation of more parsimonious solutions, importance of the MLP/BP bias and possibly worse performance of improved training algorithms).

Firstly, selection for mating is distributed. Individuals live in a 2-D world. Selection of a mate is done by each individual independently in its neighborhood. Secondly, each individual may improve its fitness during its lifetime by e.g. local hill-climbing. The PGA is totally asynchronous, running with maximal efficiency on MIMD parallel computers. The search strategy of the PGA is based on a small number of active and intelligent individuals, whereas a GA uses a large population of passive individuals. We will investigate the PGA with deceptive problems and the traveling salesman problem. We outline why and when the PGA is succesful. Abstractly, a PGA is a parallel search with information exchange between the individuals. If we represent the optimization problem as a fitness landscape in a certain configuration space, we see, that a PGA tries to jump from two local minima to a third, still better local minima, by using the crossover operator. This jump is (probabilistically) successful, if the fitness landscape has a certain correlation. We show the correlation for the traveling salesman problem by a configuration space analysis. The PGA explores implicitly the above correlation.",

However, satisfactory approximately optimal explanations may be found by the use of Evolutionary Programming. It has been shown that an information theoretic measure of finite state machine explanations can be used as the fitness function required for the evaluation of candidate explanations during the search for a near-optimal explanation. It is not obvious from the measure which class of explanation will be favoured over others during the search. By empirical studies it is possible to gain some insight into the dimensions the measure is optimising. In general, for probabilistic finite state machines, explanations assessed by a minimum message length estimator with the minimum number of transitions will be favoured over other explanations. The information measure will also favour explanations with uneven distributions of frequencies on transitions from a node suggesting that repeated sequences in symbol strings will be preferred as an explanation. Approximate bounds for acceptance of explanations and the length of string required for induction to be successful are also derived by considerations of the simplest possible and random explanations and their information measure.

    "text": "Title: Introduction to the Special Section on Knowledge-Based Construction of Probabilistic and Decision Models (IEEE Transactions\nAbstract: Modeling techniques developed recently in the AI and uncertain reasoning communities permit significantly more flexible specifications of probabilistic knowledge. Specifically, graphical decision-modeling formalisms|belief networks, influence diagrams, and their variants|provide compact representation of probabilistic relationships, and support inference algorithms that automatically exploit the dependence structure in such models [1, 3, 4]. These advances have brought on a resurgence of interest in computational decision systems based on normative theories of belief and preference. However, graphical decision-modeling languages are still quite limited for purposes of knowledge representation because, while they can describe the relationships among particular event instances, they cannot capture general knowledge about probabilistic relationships across classes of events. The inability to capture general knowledge is a serious impediment for those AI tasks in which the relevant factors of a decision problem cannot be enumerated in advance. A graphical decision model encodes a particular set of probabilistic dependencies, a predefined set of decision alternatives, and a specific mathematical form for a utility function. Given a properly specified model, there exist relatively efficient algorithms for calculating posterior probabilities and optimal decision policies. A range of similar cases may be handled by parametric variations of the original model. However, if the structure of dependencies, the set of available alternatives, or the form of utility function changes from situation to situation, then a fixed network representation is no longer adequate. An ideal computational decision system would possess general, broad knowledge of a domain, but would have the ability to reason about the particular circumstances of any given decision problem within the domain. One obvious approach|which we call call knowledge-based model construction (KBMC)|is to generate a decision model dynamically at run-time, based on the problem description and information received thus far. Model construction consists of selection, instantiation, and assembly of causal and associational relationships from a broad knowledge base of general relationships among domain concepts. For example, suppose we wish to develop a system to recommend appropriate actions for maintaining a computer network. The natural graphical decision model would include chance ",

These methods do not capture the role of environmental complexity in shaping the selective pressures that control the adaptive process. Ecological simulations enabled by computational tools such as the Latent Energy Environments (LEE) model allow us to characterize more closely the effects of environmental complexity on the evolution of adaptive behaviors. LEE is described in this paper. Its motivation arises from the need to vary complexity in controlled and predictable ways, without assuming the relationship of these changes to the adaptive behaviors they engender. This goal is achieved through a careful characterization of environments in which different forms of \"energy\" are well-defined. A genetic algorithm using endogenous fitness and local selection is used to model the evolutionary process. Individuals in the population are modeled by neural networks with simple sensory-motor systems, and variations in their behaviors are related to interactions with varying environments.

However, it has the limitation known as \"closure\", i.e. that all the variables, constants, arguments for functions, and values returned from functions must be of the same data type. To correct this deficiency, we introduce a variation of genetic programming called \"strongly typed\" genetic programming (STGP). In STGP, variables, constants, arguments, and returned values can be of any data type with the provision that the data type for each such value be specified beforehand. This allows the initialization process and the genetic operators to only generate syntactically correct parse trees. Key concepts for STGP are generic functions, which are not true strongly typed functions but rather templates for classes of such functions, and generic data types, which are analogous. To illustrate STGP, we present four examples involving vector/matrix manipulation and list manipulation: (1) the multi-dimensional least-squares regression problem, (2) the multi-dimensional Kalman filter, (3) the list manipulation function NTH, and (4) the list manipulation function MAPCAR.",

When a new counterexample arrives it tries to extend the model in a minimal fashion. We conducted a set of experiments where random automata that represent different strategies were generated, and the algorithm tried to learn them based on prefix-closed samples of their behavior. The algorithm managed to learn very compact models that agree with the samples. The size of the sample had a small effect on the size of the model. The experimental results suggest that for random prefix-closed samples the algorithm behaves well.

This paper clarifies the uses of this term and shows how to measure and visualize the statistical bias and variance of learning algorithms. Statistical bias and variance can be applied to diagnose problems with machine learning bias, and the paper shows four examples of this. Finally, the paper discusses methods of reducing bias and variance. Methods based on voting can reduce variance, and the paper compares Breiman's bagging method and our own tree randomization method for voting decision trees. Both methods uniformly improve performance on data sets from the Irvine repository. Tree randomization yields perfect performance on the Letter Recognition task. A weighted nearest neighbor algorithm based on the infinite bootstrap is also introduced. In general, decision tree algorithms have moderate-to-high variance, so an important implication of this work is that variance|rather than appropriate or inappropriate machine learning bias|is an important cause of poor performance for decision tree algorithms.

This means that some cases may be retrieved in error in that the case may fail to improve the planner's performance. Retrieval may be incrementally improved by detecting and explaining these failures as they occur. In this paper we provide a definition of case failure for the planner, dersnlp (derivation replay in snlp), which solves new problems by replaying its previous plan derivations. We provide EBL (explanation-based learning) techniques for detecting and constructing the reasons for the failure. We also describe how to organize a case library so as to incorporate this failure information as it is produced. Finally we present an empirical study which demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach in improving the performance of dersnlp.",

Abstract The developmental mechanisms transforming genotypic to phenotypic forms are typically omitted in formulations of genetic algorithms (GAs) in which these two representational spaces are identical. We argue that a careful analysis of developmental mechanisms is useful when understanding the success of several standard GA techniques, and can clarify the relationships between more recently proposed enhancements. We provide a framework which distinguishes between two developmental mechanisms | learning and maturation | while also showing several common effects on GA search. This framework is used to analyze how maturation and local search can change the dynamics of the GA. We observe that in some contexts, maturation and local search can be incorporated into the fitness evaluation, but illustrate reasons for considering them seperately. Further, we identify contexts in which maturation and local search can be distinguished from the fitness evaluation. ",

Unlike popular learning-from-example methods, in such tasks, we must interpret the characteristics of the data without clear features of the data nor pre-determined evaluation criteria. The problem is how domain experts get simple, easy-to-understand, and accurate knowledge from noisy data. This paper describes a novel method to acquire efficient decision rules from questionnaire data using both simulated breeding and inductive learning techniques. The basic ideas of the method are that simulated breeding is used to get the effective features from the questionnaire data and that inductive learning is used to acquire simple decision rules from the data. The simulated breeding is one of the Genetic Algorithm based techniques to subjectively or interactively evaluate the qualities of offspring generated by genetic operations. The proposed method has been qualitatively and quantitatively validated by a case study on consumer product questionnaire data: the acquired rules are simpler than the results from the direct application of inductive learning; a domain expert admits that they are easy to understand; and they are at the same level on the accuracy compared with the other methods.

Distance functions like the Hamming-distance or their transformation into similarity functions are applied to retrieve past cases to be used to generate the solution of an actual problem. Often, domain knowledge is available to adapt past solutions to new problems or to evaluate solutions. However, there are domains like architectural design or law in which structural case representations and corresponding structural similarity functions are needed. Often, the acquisition of adaptation knowledge seems to be impossible or rather requires an effort that is not manageable for fielded applications. Despite of this, humans use cases as the main source to generate adapted solutions. How to achieve this computationally? This paper presents a general approach to structural similarity assessment and adaptation. The approach allows to explore structural case representations and limited domain knowledge to support design tasks. It is exemplarily instantiated in three modules of the design assistant FABEL-Idea that generates adapted design solutions on the basis of prior CAD layouts.",

Different models of problem solving, however, recognize different knowledge needs, and, as a result, set up different learning tasks. Some recent models analyze problem solving in terms of generic tasks, methods, and subtasks. These models require the learning of problem-solving concepts such as new tasks and new task decompositions. We view reflection as a core process for learning these problem-solving concepts. In this paper, we identify the learning issues raised by the task-structure framework of problem solving. We view the problem solver as an abstract device, and represent how it works in terms of a structure-behavior-function model which specifies how the knowledge and reasoning of the problem solver results in the accomplishment of its tasks. We describe how this model enables reflection, and how model-based reflection enables the reasoner to adapt its task structure to produce solutions of better quality. The Autognostic system illustrates this reflection process. ",

Ideally, this joint cooperation has the potential of achieving better plans than either the human or the machine can create alone. Human planners often take a case-based approach to planning, relying on their past experience and planning by retrieving and adapting past planning cases. Planning by analogical reasoning in which generative and case-based planning are combined, as in Prodigy/Analogy, provides a suitable framework to study this mixed-initiative integration. However, having a human user engaged in this planning loop creates a variety of new research questions. The challenges we found creating a mixed-initiative planning system fall into three categories: planning paradigms differ in human and machine planning; visualization of the plan and planning process is a complex, but necessary task; and human users range across a spectrum of experience, both with respect to the planning domain and the underlying planning technology. This paper presents our approach to these three problems when designing an interface to incorporate a human into the process of planning by analogical reasoning with Prodigy/Analogy. The interface allows the user to follow both generative and case-based planning, it supports visualization of both plan and the planning rationale, and it addresses the variance in the experience of the user by allowing the user to control the presentation of information.",

In the linear combination scheme, soft competition on different feature sets is adopted as an automatic feature rank mechanism so that different feature sets can be always simultaneously used in an optimal way to determine linear combination weights. For training the linear combination scheme, a learning algorithm is developed based on Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. The proposed method has been applied to a typical real world problem, viz. speaker identification, in which different feature sets often need consideration simultaneously for robustness. Simulation results show that the proposed method yields good performance in speaker identification.",

    "text": "Title: Towards a General Distributed Platform for Learning and Generalization and Word Perfect Corp. 1 Introduction\nAbstract: Different learning models employ different styles of generalization on novel inputs. This paper proposes the need for multiple styles of generalization to support a broad application base. The Priority ASOCS model (Priority Adaptive Self-Organizing Concurrent System) is overviewed and presented as a potential platform which can support multiple generalization styles. PASOCS is an adaptive network composed of many simple computing elements operating asynchronously and in parallel. The PASOCS can operate in either a data processing mode or a learning mode. During data processing mode, the system acts as a parallel hardware circuit. During learning mode, the PASOCS incorporates rules, with attached priorities, which represent the application being learned. Learning is accomplished in a distributed fashion in time logarithmic in the number of rules. The new model has significant learning time and space complexity improvements over previous models. Generalization in a learning system is at best always a guess. The proper style of generalization is application dependent. Thus, one style of generalization may not be sufficient to allow a learning system to support a broad spectrum of applications [14]. Current connectionist models use one specific style of generalization which is implicit in the learning algorithm. We suggest that the type of generalization used be a self-organizing parameter of the learning system which can be discovered as learning takes place. This requires a) a model which allows flexible generalization styles, and b) mechanisms to guide the system into the best style of generalization for the problem being learned. This paper overviews a learning model which seeks to efficiently support requirement a) above. The model is called Priority ASOCS (PASOCS) [9], which is a member of a class of models called ASOCS (Adaptive Self-Organizing Concurrent Systems) [5]. Section 2 of this paper gives an example of how different generalization techniques can approach a problem. Section 3 presents an overview of PASOCS. Section 4 illustrates how flexible generalization can be supported. Section 5 concludes the paper. ",

The basic idea is to exploit the intrinsic metric structure of a hypothesis space, as determined by the natural distribution of unlabeled training patterns, and use this metric as a reference to detect whether the empirical error estimates derived from a small (labeled) training sample can be trusted in the region around an empirically optimal hypothesis. Using simple metric intuitions we develop new geometric strategies for detecting overfitting and performing robust yet responsive model selection in spaces of candidate functions. These new metric-based strategies dramatically outperform previous approaches in experimental studies of classical polynomial curve fitting. Moreover, the technique is simple, efficient, and can be applied to most function learning tasks. The only requirement is access to an auxiliary collection of unlabeled training data. ",

TPOT-RL introduces the concept of using action-dependent features to generalize the state space. In our work, we use a learned action-dependent feature space. TPOT-RL is an effective technique to allow a team of agents to learn to cooperate towards the achievement of a specific goal. It is an adaptation of traditional RL methods that is applicable in complex, non-Markovian, multi-agent domains with large state spaces and limited training opportunities. Multi-agent scenarios are opaque-transition, as team members are not always in full communication with one another and adversaries may affect the environment. Hence, each learner cannot rely on having knowledge of future state transitions after acting in the world. TPOT-RL enables teams of agents to learn effective policies with very few training examples even in the face of a large state space with large amounts of hidden state. The main responsible features are: dividing the learning task among team members, using a very coarse, action-dependent feature space, and allowing agents to gather reinforcement directly from observation of the environment. TPOT-RL is fully implemented and has been tested in the robotic soccer domain, a complex, multi-agent framework. This paper presents the algorithmic details of TPOT-RL as well as empirical results demonstrating the effectiveness of the developed multi-agent learning approach with learned features.",

In this paper we evaluate these methods using both neural networks and decision trees as our classification algorithms. Our results clearly show two important facts. The first is that even though Bagging almost always produces a better classifier than any of its individual component classifiers and is relatively impervious to overfitting, it does not generalize any better than a baseline neural-network ensemble method. The second is that Boosting is a powerful technique that can usually produce better ensembles than Bagging; however, it is more susceptible to noise and can quickly overfit a data set. ",

    "text": "Title: Hidden Markov Modeling of simultaneously recorded cells in the Associative cortex of behaving monkeys  \nAbstract: A widely held idea regarding information processing in the brain is the cell-assembly hypothesis suggested by Hebb in 1949. According to this hypothesis, the basic unit of information processing in the brain is an assembly of cells, which can act briefly as a closed system, in response to a specific stimulus. This work presents a novel method of characterizing this supposed activity using a Hidden Markov Model. This model is able to reveal some of the underlying cortical network activity of behavioral processes. In our study the process in hand was the simultaneous activity of several cells recorded from the frontal cortex of behaving monkeys. Using such a model we were able to identify the behavioral mode of the animal and directly identify the corresponding collective network activity. Furthermore, the segmentation of the data into the discrete states also provides direct evidence for the state dependency of the short-time correlation functions between the same pair of cells. Thus, this cross-correlation depends on the network state of activity and not on local connectivity alone.",

An ensemble of simple feed-forward neural networks are used to rate each of the images. The outputs of these networks are then combined to generate a score for each emotion. The networks were trained on a database of face images that human subjects consistently rated as portraying a single emotion. Such a system achieves 86% generalization on novel face images (individuals the networks were not trained on) drawn from the same database. The neural network model exhibits categorical perception between some emotion pairs. A linear sequence of morph images is created between two expressions of an individual's face and this sequence is analyzed by the model. Sharp transitions in the output response vector occur in a single step in the sequence for some emotion pairs and not for others. We plan to us the model's response to limit and direct testing in determining if human subjects exhibit categorical perception in morph image sequences. ",

In that case, the state space can be represented as a tree, and a solution is a path from the root of that tree to a leaf. This paper describes how the simulated evolution of a population of such non-deterministic incremental algorithms offers a new approach for the exploration of a state space, compared to other techniques like Genetic Algorithms (GA), Evolutionary Strategies (ES) or Hill Climbing. In particular, the efficiency of this method, implemented as the Evolving Non-Determinism (END) model, is presented for the sorting network problem, a reference problem that has challenged computer science. Then, we shall show that the END model remedies some drawbacks of these optimization techniques and even outperforms them for this problem. Indeed, some 16-input sorting networks as good as the best known have been built from scratch, and even a 25-year-old result for the 13-input problem has been improved by one comparator.",

Projective components are needed for long-term planning and replanning where explicit reasoning about future states is required. Reactive components allow the system to always have some action available in real-time, and themselves can exhibit robust behavior, but lack the ability to expli - citly reason about future states over a long time period. This work addresses the problem of creating reactive components for autonomous vehicles. Creating reactive behaviors (stimulus-response rules) is generally difficult, requiring the acquisition of much knowledge from domain experts, a problem referred to as the knowledge acquisition bottleneck. SAMUEL is a system that learns reactive behaviors for autonomous agents. SAMUEL learns these behaviors under simulation, automating the process of creating stimulus-response rules and therefore reducing the bottleneck. The learning algorithm was designed to learn useful behaviors from simulations of limited fidelity. Current work is investigating how well behaviors learned under simulation environments work in real world environments. In this paper, we describe SAMUEL, and describe behaviors that have been learned for simulated autonomous aircraft, autonomous underwater vehicles, and robots. These behaviors include dog fighting, missile evasion, track - ing, navigation, and obstacle avoidance. ",

It has been pointed out before that this technique may be outperformed by the classical perceptron learning rule, at least on some problems. In this paper, we show that no such pathologies can arise if the error criterion is of a threshold LMS type, i.e., is zero for values \"beyond\" the desired target values. More precisely, we show that if the data are linearly separable, and one considers nets with no hidden neurons, then an error function as above cannot have any local minima that are not global. Simulations of networks with hidden units are consistent with these results, in that often data which can be classified when minimizing a threshold LMS criterion may fail to be classified when using instead a simple LMS cost. In addition, the proof gives the following stronger result, under the stated hypotheses: the continuous gradient adjustment procedure is such that from any initial weight configuration a separating set of weights is obtained in finite time. This is a precise analogue of the Perceptron Learning Theorem. The results are then compared with the more classical pattern recognition problem of threshold LMS with linear activations, where no spurious local minima exist even for nonseparable data: here it is shown that even if using the threshold criterion, such bad local minima may occur, if the data are not separable and sigmoids are used.

Yet some dissent has been expressed as to its implications. Here, dissenting arguments are reviewed and elaborated upon, explaining why the Schema Theorem has no implications for how well a GA is performing. Interpretations of the Schema Theorem have implicitly assumed that a correlation exists between parent and offspring fitnesses, and this assumption is made explicit in results based on Price's Covariance and Selection Theorem. Schemata do not play a part in the performance theorems derived for representations and operators in general. However, schemata re-emerge when recombination operators are used. Using Geiringer's recombination distribution representation of recombination operators, a \"missing\" schema theorem is derived which makes explicit the intuition for when a GA should perform well. Finally, the method of \"adaptive landscape\" analysis is examined and counterexamples offered to the commonly used correlation statistic. Instead, an alternative statistic | the transmission function in the fitness domain | is proposed as the optimal statistic for estimating GA performance from limited samples.",

The method uses best-first search and cross-validation to wrap around the basic induction algorithm: the search explores the space of parameter values, running the basic algorithm many times on training and holdout sets produced by cross-validation to get an estimate of the expected error of each parameter setting. Thus, the final selected parameter settings are tuned for the specific induction algorithm and dataset being studied.

At a 90% confidence level, our method improves the performance of C4.5 on nine domains, degrades performance on one, and is statistically indistinguishable from C4.5 on the rest.

In many applications, it is desirable to minimize the number of measurements collected for this purpose, while ensuring sufficient localization accuracy. In surgery, for example, collecting a large number of localization measurements may either extend the time required to perform a surgical procedure, or increase the radiation dosage to which a patient is exposed. Localization accuracy is a function of the spatial distribution of discrete measurements over an object when measurement noise is present. In [Simon et al., 1995a], metrics were presented to evaluate the information available from a set of discrete object measurements. In this study, new approaches to the discrete point data selection problem are described. These include hillclimbing, genetic algorithms (GAs), and Population-Based Incremental Learning (PBIL). Extensions of the standard GA and PBIL methods, which employ multiple parallel populations, are explored. The results of extensive empirical testing are provided. The results suggest that a combination of PBIL and hillclimbing result in the best overall performance.

Yet, there still does not exist a theory which accurately describes the complete process. We believe that these past attempts fell short due to an incomplete understanding of the overall task of reading; namely, the complete set of mental tasks a reasoner must perform to read and the mechanisms that carry out these tasks. We present a functional theory of the reading process and argue that it represents a coverage of the task. The theory combines experimental results from psychology, artificial intelligence, education, and linguistics, along with the insights we have gained from our own research. This greater understanding of the mental tasks necessary for reading will enable new natural language understanding systems to be more flexible and more capable than earlier ones. Furthermore, we argue that creativity is a necessary component of the reading process and must be considered in any theory or system attempting to describe it. We present a functional theory of creative reading and a novel knowledge organization scheme that supports the creativity mechanisms.

The step function that appears in the objective function can be approximated by a sigmoid or by a concave exponential on the nonnegative real line, or it can be treated exactly by considering the equivalent linear program with equilibrium constraints (LPEC). Computational tests of these three approaches on publicly available real-world databases have been carried out and compared with an adaptation of the optimal brain damage (OBD) method for reducing neural network complexity. One feature selection algorithm via concave minimization (FSV) reduced cross-validation error on a cancer prognosis database by 35.4% while reducing problem features from 32 to 4. Feature selection is an important problem in machine learning [18, 15, 16, 17, 33]. In its basic form the problem consists of eliminating as many of the features in a given problem as possible, while still carrying out a preassigned task with acceptable accuracy. Having a minimal number of features often leads to better generalization and simpler models that can be more easily interpreted. In the present work, our task is to discriminate between two given sets in an n-dimensional feature space by using as few of the given features as possible. We shall formulate this problem as a mathematical program with a parametric objective function that will attempt to achieve this task by generating a separating plane in a feature space of as small a dimension as possible while minimizing the average distance of misclassified points to the plane. One of the computational experiments that we carried out on our feature selection procedure showed its effectiveness, not only in minimizing the number of features selected, but also in quickly recognizing and removing spurious random features that were introduced. Thus, on the Wisconsin Prognosis Breast Cancer WPBC database [36] with a feature space of 32 dimensions and 6 random features added, one of our algorithms FSV (11) immediately removed the 6 random features as well as 28 of the original features resulting in a separating plane in a 4-dimensional reduced feature space. By using tenfold cross-validation [35], separation error in the 4-dimensional space was reduced 35.4% from the corresponding error in the original problem space. (See Section 3 for details.) We note that mathematical programming approaches to the feature selection problem have been recently proposed in [4, 22]. Even though the approach of [4] is based on an LPEC formulation, both the LPEC and its method of solution are different from the ones used here. The polyhedral concave minimization approach of [22] is principally involved with theoretical considerations of one specific algorithm and no cross-validatory results are given. Other effective computational applications of mathematical programming to neural networks are given in [30, 26]. ",

In an HMM, information about the past of the time series is conveyed through a single discrete variable|the hidden state. We present a generalization of HMMs in which this state is factored into multiple state variables and is therefore represented in a distributed manner. Both inference and learning in this model depend critically on computing the posterior probabilities of the hidden state variables given the observations. We present an exact algorithm for inference in this model, and relate it to the Forward-Backward algorithm for HMMs and to algorithms for more general belief networks. Due to the combinatorial nature of the hidden state representation, this exact algorithm is intractable. As in other intractable systems, approximate inference can be carried out using Gibbs sampling or mean field theory. We also present a structured approximation in which the the state variables are decoupled, based on which we derive a tractable learning algorithm. Empirical comparisons suggest that these approximations are efficient and accurate alternatives to the exact methods. Finally, we use the structured approximation to model Bach's chorales and show that it outperforms HMMs in capturing the complex temporal patterns in this dataset.",

Some original analyses and comments are also provided in section 5.8, 5.11 and 5.12. There is a latent rivalry between \"Bayesian\" and \"Orthodox\" statistics. It is by no means our intention to enter this kind of controversy. We are perfectly willing to accept orthodox as well as unorthodox methods, as long as they are scientifically sound and provide good results when applied to learning tasks. The same disclaimer applies to the two frameworks presented here. They have been the object of heated controversy in the past 3 years in the neural networks community. We will not take side, but only present both frameworks, with their strong points and their weaknesses. In the context of this work, the \"Bayesian frameworks\" are especially interesting as the provide some continuous update rules that can be used during regularised cost minimisation to yield an automatic selection of the regularisation level. Unlike the methods presented in chapter 3, it is not necessary to try several regularisation levels and perform as many optimisations. The Bayesian framework is the only one in which training is achieved through a one-pass optimisation procedure. ",

This method is a new approach to the problem of optimal compression when a source code produces multiple codewords for a given symbol. It may seem that the most sensible codeword to use in this case is the shortest one. However, in the proposed bits-back approach, random codeword selection yields an effective codeword length that can be less than the shortest codeword length. If the random choices are Boltzmann distributed, the effective length is optimal for the given source code. The software which I describe in this guide is easy to use and the source code is only a few pages long. I illustrate the bits-back coding software on a simple quantized Gaussian mixture problem. ",

The central idea we explore is that the contents of consciousness correspond to temporally persistent states in a network of computational modules. Three simulations are described illustrating that the behavior of persistent states in the models corresponds roughly to the behavior of conscious states people experience when performing similar tasks.

Using a simple method for inserting prior knowledge (or rules) into recurrent neural networks, we show that recurrent neural networks are able to perform rule revision. Rule revision is performed by comparing the inserted rules with the rules in the finite-state automata extracted from trained networks. The results from training a recurrent neural network to recognize a known non-trivial, randomly generated regular grammar show that not only do the networks preserve correct rules but that they are able to correct through training inserted rules which were initially incorrect. (By incorrect, we mean that the rules were not the ones in the randomly generated grammar.) ",

Against this very general backdrop, any methods for improving the generalization performance, or for improving the speed in test phase, of SVMs are of increasing interest. In this paper we combine two such techniques on a pattern recognition problem. The method for improving generalization performance (the \"virtual support vector\" method) does so by incorporating known invariances of the problem. This method achieves a drop in the error rate on 10,000 NIST test digit images of 1.4% to 1.0%. The method for improving the speed (the \"reduced set\" method) does so by approximating the support vector decision surface. We apply this method to achieve a factor of fifty speedup in test phase over the virtual support vector machine. The combined approach yields a machine which is both 22 times faster than the original machine, and which has better generalization performance, achieving 1.1% error. The virtual support vector method is applicable to any SVM problem with known invariances. The reduced set method is applicable to any support vector machine. ",

Since we make no assumptions about the number of possible set elements, this extension of the traditional feature-vector representation is closely connected to Blum's \"infinite attribute\" representation. We argue that many decision tree and rule learning algorithms can be easily extended to set-valued features. We also show by example that many real-world learning problems can be efficiently and naturally represented with set-valued features; in particular, text categorization problems and problems that arise in propositionalizing first-order representations lend themselves to set-valued features.

    "text": "Title: Modeling Volatility using State Space Models  \nAbstract: In time series problems, noise can be divided into two categories: dynamic noise which drives the process, and observational noise which is added in the measurement process, but does not influence future values of the system. In this framework, empirical volatilities (the squared relative returns of prices) exhibit a significant amount of observational noise. To model and predict their time evolution adequately, we estimate state space models that explicitly include observational noise. We obtain relaxation times for shocks in the logarithm of volatility ranging from three weeks (for foreign exchange) to three to five months (for stock indices). In most cases, a two-dimensional hidden state is required to yield residuals that are consistent with white noise. We compare these results with ordinary autoregressive models (without a hidden state) and find that autoregressive models underestimate the relaxation times by about two orders of magnitude due to their ignoring the distinction between observational and dynamic noise. This new interpretation of the dynamics of volatility in terms of relaxators in a state space model carries over to stochastic volatility models and to GARCH models, and is useful for several problems in finance, including risk management and the pricing of derivative securities.

An ASOCS is an adaptive network composed of many simple computing elements operating asynchronously and in parallel. An ASOCS can operate in either a data processing mode or a learning mode. During data processing mode, an ASOCS acts as a parallel hardware circuit. During learning mode, an ASOCS incorporates a rule expressed as a Boolean conjunction in a distributed fashion in time logarithmic in the number of rules. This paper proposes a learning algorithm and architecture for Priority ASOCS. This new ASOCS model uses rules with priorities. The new model has significant learning time and space complexity improvements over previous models. Non-von Neumann architectures such as neural networks attack the word-at-a-time bottleneck of traditional computing systems [1]. Neural networks learn input-output mappings using highly distributed processing and memory [10,11,12]. Their numerous simple processing elements with modifiable weighted links permit a high degree of parallelism. A typical neural network has fixed topology. It learns by modifying weighted links between nodes. A new class of connectionist architectures has been proposed called ASOCS (Adaptive Self-Organizing Concurrent Systems) [4,5]. ASOCS models support efficient computation through self-organized learning and parallel execution. Learning is done through the incremental presentation of rules and/or examples. ASOCS models learn by modifying their topology. Data types include Boolean and multi-state variables; recent models support analog variables. The model incorporates rules into an adaptive logic network in a parallel and self organizing fashion. In processing mode, ASOCS supports fully parallel execution on actual inputs according to the learned rules. The adaptive logic network acts as a parallel hardware circuit during execution, mapping n input boolean vectors into m output boolean vectors, in a combinatoric fashion. The overall philosophy of ASOCS follows the high level goals of current neural network models. However, the mechanisms of learning and execution vary significantly. The ASOCS logic network is topologically dynamic with the network growing to efficiently fit the specific application. Current ASOCS models are based on digital nodes. ASOCS also supports use of symbolic and heuristic learning mechanisms, thus combining the parallelism and distributed nature of connectionist computing with the potential power of AI symbolic learning. A proof of concept ASOCS chip has been developed [2]. ",

How is that structure to be described, and how can its behavioral consequences be explained and predicted? We aim to establish initial answers to these questions by simulating the evolution of very simple organisms in simple environments with different structures. Our artificial creatures, called \"minimats,\" have neither sensors nor memory and behave solely by picking amongst the actions of moving, eating, reproducing, and sitting, according to an inherited probability distribution. Our simulated environments contain only food (and multiple minimats) and are structured in terms of their spatial and temporal food density and the patchiness with which the food appears. Changes in these environmental parameters affect the evolved behaviors of minimats in different ways, and all three parameters are of importance in describing the minimat world. One of the most useful behavioral strategies that evolves is \"looping\" movement, which allows minimats-despite their lack of internal state-to match their behavior to the temporal (and spatial) structure of their environment. Ultimately we find that minimats construct their own environments through their individual behaviors, making the study of the impact of global environment structure on individual behavior much more complex.

In such domains, the examples can be treated as points and distance metrics can use standard definitions. In symbolic domains, a more sophisticated treatment of the feature space is required. We introduce a nearest neighbor algorithm for learning in domains with symbolic features. Our algorithm calculates distance tables that allow it to produce real-valued distances between instances, and attaches weights to the instances to further modify the structure of feature space. We show that this technique produces excellent classification accuracy on three problems that have been studied by machine learning researchers: predicting protein secondary structure, identifying DNA promoter sequences, and pronouncing English text. Direct experimental comparisons with the other learning algorithms show that our nearest neighbor algorithm is comparable or superior in all three domains. In addition, our algorithm has advantages in training speed, simplicity, and perspicuity. We conclude that experimental evidence favors the use and continued development of nearest neighbor algorithms for domains such as the ones studied here. ",

However, most studies were done on small databases. We show that in some larger databases, the accuracy of Naive-Bayes does not scale up as well as decision trees.

Much of the rapid development of these models in the last decade has been a direct result of advances in simulation-based computational methods. Some of the very early work in this area, circa 1988-1991, focused on the use of such nonparametric ideas and models in applications of otherwise standard hierarchical models. This chapter provides some historical review and perspective on these developments, with a prime focus on the use and integration of such nonparametric ideas in hierarchical models. We illustrate the ease with which the strict parametric assumptions common to most standard Bayesian hierarchical models can be relaxed to incorporate uncertainties about functional forms using Dirichlet process components, partly enabled by the approach to computation using MCMC methods. The resulting methology is illustrated with two examples taken from an unpublished 1992 report on the topic.",

    "text": "Title: An Analysis of Bayesian Classifiers (1988), involves the formulation of average-case models for specific algorithms\nAbstract: In this paper we present an average-case analysis of the Bayesian classifier, a simple induction algorithm that fares remarkably well on many learning tasks. Our analysis assumes a monotone conjunctive target concept, and independent, noise-free Boolean attributes. We calculate the probability that the algorithm will induce an arbitrary pair of concept descriptions and then use this to compute the probability of correct classification over the instance space. The analysis takes into account the number of training instances, the number of attributes, the distribution of these attributes, and the level of class noise. We also explore the behavioral implications of the analysis by presenting predicted learning curves for artificial domains, and give experimental results on these domains as a check on our reasoning. One goal of research in machine learning is to discover principles that relate algorithms and domain characteristics to behavior. To this end, many researchers have carried out systematic experimentation with natural and artificial domains in search of empirical regularities (e.g., Kibler & Langley, 1988). Others have focused on theoretical analyses, often within the paradigm of probably approximately correct learning (e.g., Haus-sler, 1990). However, most experimental studies are based only on informal analyses of the learning task, whereas most formal analyses address the worst case, and thus bear little relation to empirical results. ber of attributes, and the class and attribute frequencies, they obtain predictions about the behavior of induction algorithms and used experiments to check their analyses. 1 However, their research does not focus on algorithms typically used by the experimental and practical sides of machine learning, and it is important that average-case analyses be extended to such methods. Recently, there has been growing interest in probabilistic approaches to inductive learning. For example, Fisher (1987) has described Cobweb, an incremental algorithm for conceptual clustering that draws heavily on Bayesian ideas, and the literature reports a number of systems that build on this work (e.g., Allen & Lang-ley, 1990; Iba & Gennari, 1991; Thompson & Langley, 1991). Cheeseman et al. (1988) have outlined Auto-Class, a nonincremental system that uses Bayesian methods to cluster instances into groups, and other researchers have focused on the induction of Bayesian inference networks (e.g., Cooper & Kerskovits, 1991). These recent Bayesian learning algorithms are complex and not easily amenable to analysis, but they share a common ancestor that is simpler and more tractable. This supervised algorithm, which we refer to simply as a Bayesian classifier, comes originally from work in pattern recognition (Duda & Hart, 1973). The method stores a probabilistic summary for each class; this summary contains the conditional probability of each attribute value given the class, as well as the probability (or base rate) of the class. This data structure approximates the representational power of a perceptron; it describes a single decision boundary through the instance space. When the algorithm encounters a new instance, it updates the probabilities stored with the specified class. Neither the order of training instances nor the occurrence of classification errors have any effect on this process. When given a test instance, the classifier uses an evaluation function (which we describe in detail later) to rank the alter ",

The scheme is implemented in our Designer Net framework for network training and pruning, i.e., is based on the diagonal Hessian approximation. The scheme does not require essential computational overhead in addition to what is needed for training and pruning. The viability of the approach is demonstrated in an experiment concerning prediction of the chaotic Mackey-Glass series. We find that the optimized weight decays are relatively large for densely connected networks in the initial pruning phase, while they decrease as pruning proceeds. ",

We demonstrate that, with high probability, it is still possible to learn monotone DNF formulas in polynomial time, provided that the fraction of missing answers is bounded by some constant less than one. Even when half the membership queries are expected to yield no information, our algorithm will exactly identify m-term, n-variable monotone DNF formulas with an expected O(mn 2 ) queries. The same task has been shown to require exponential time using equivalence queries alone. We extend the algorithm to handle some one-sided errors, and discuss several other possible error models.

This implies that learning the \"right\" indices to a case before storing it for potential reuse is crucial for the success of the method. A hierarchical organization of the case memory raises two distinct but related issues in index learning: learning the indexing vocabulary, and learning the right level of generalization. In this paper we show how the use of structure-behavior-function (SBF) models constrains index learning in the context of experience-based design of physical devices. The SBF model of a design provides the functional and causal explanation of how the structure of the design delivers its function. We describe how the SBF model of a design, together with a specification of the task for which the design case might be reused, provides the vocabulary for indexing the design case in memory. We also discuss how the prior design experiences stored in case-memory help to determine the level of index generalization. The KRITIK2 system implements and evaluates the model-based method for learning indices to design cases.",

As a matter of fact, the primary goal is to bring into a neural network architecture the capability of dealing with structured data of unrestricted size, by allowing to dynamically bind the classification rules to different items occur ring in the input data.

Much less is known about the theory of learning functions with a larger range such as IN or IR. In particular relatively few results exist about the general structure of common models for function learning, and there are only very few nontrivial function classes for which positive learning results have been exhibited in any of these models. We introduce in this paper the notion of a binary branching adversary tree for function learning, which allows us to give a somewhat surprising equivalent characterization of the optimal learning cost for learning a class of real-valued functions (in terms of a max-min definition which does not involve any \"learning\" model). Another general structural result of this paper relates the cost for learning a union of function classes to the learning costs for the individual function classes. Furthermore, we exhibit an efficient learning algorithm for learning convex piecewise linear functions from IR d into IR. Previously, the class of linear functions from IR d into IR was the only class of functions with multi-dimensional domain that was known to be learnable within the rigorous framework of a formal model for on-line learning. Finally we give a sufficient condition for an arbitrary class F of functions from IR into IR that allows us to learn the class of all functions that can be written as the pointwise maximum of k functions from F . This allows us to exhibit a number of further nontrivial classes of functions from IR into IR for which there exist efficient learning algorithms. ",

Subroutine creation or discovery is performed automatically based on the differential parent-offspring fitness and block activation.

Our method augments the CBR system with an introspective reasoning component which monitors system performance to detect poor retrievals, identifies features which would lead to retrieving cases requiring less adaptation, and refines the indices to include such features in order to avoid similar future failures. We explore the benefit of introspective reasoning by performing empirical tests on the implemented system. These tests examine the benefits of introspective index refinement and the effects of problem order on case and index learning, and show that introspective learning of new index features improves overall performance across the range of different problem orders.",

    "text": "Title: MCMC CONVERGENCE DIAGNOSTIC VIA THE CENTRAL LIMIT THEOREM  \nAbstract: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, as introduced by Gelfand and Smith (1990), provide a simulation based strategy for statistical inference. The application fields related to these methods, as well as theoretical convergence properties, have been intensively studied in the recent literature. However, many improvements are still expected to provide workable and theoretically well-grounded solutions to the problem of monitoring the convergence of actual outputs from MCMC algorithms (i.e. the convergence assessment problem). In this paper, we introduce and discuss a methodology based on the Central Limit Theorem for Markov chains to assess convergence of MCMC algorithms. Instead of searching for approximate stationarity, we primarily intend to control the precision of estimates of the invariant probability measure, or of integrals of functions with respect to this measure, through confidence regions based on normal approximation. The first proposed control method tests the normality hypothesis for normalized averages of functions of the Markov chain over independent parallel chains. This normality control provides good guarantees that the whole state space has been explored, even in multimodal situations. It can lead to automated stopping rules. A second tool connected with the normality control is based on graphical monitoring of the stabilization of the variance after n iterations near the limiting variance appearing in the CLT. Both methods require no knowledge of the sampler driving the chain. In this paper, we mainly focus on finite state Markov chains, since this setting allows us to derive consistent estimates of both the limiting variance and the variance after n iterations. Heuristic procedures based on Berry-Esseen bounds are investigated. An extension to the continuous case is also proposed. Numerical simulations illustrating the performance of these methods are given for several examples: a finite chain with multimodal invariant probability, a finite state random walk for which the theoretical rate of convergence to stationarity is known, and a continuous state chain with multimodal invariant probability issued from a Gibbs sampler.

The network has bottom-up \"recognition\" connections that are used to convert sensory input into underlying representations. Unlike most artificial neural networks, it also has top-down \"generative\" connections that can be used to reconstruct the sensory input from the representations. In the \"wake\" phase of the learning algorithm, the network is driven by the bottom-up recognition connections and the top-down generative connections are trained to be better at reconstructing the sensory input from the representation chosen by the recognition process. In the \"sleep\" phase, the network is driven top-down by the generative connections to produce a fantasized representation and a fantasized sensory input. The recognition connections are then trained to be better at recovering the fantasized representation from the fantasized sensory input. In both phases, the synaptic learning rule is simple and local. The combined effect of the two phases is to create representations of the sensory input that are efficient in the following sense: On average, it takes more bits to describe each sensory input vector directly than to first describe the representation of the sensory input chosen by the recognition process and then describe the difference between the sensory input and its reconstruction from the chosen representation.",

In this paper we discuss some basic principles that can be used to develop test suites and we examine the role of test suites as they have been used to evaluate evolutionary search algorithms. Current test suites include functions that are easily solved by simple search methods such as greedy hill-climbers.

In the square linear blind source separation problem without time delays, one must find an unmixing matrix which can detangle the result of mixing n unknown independent sources through an unknown n fi n mixing matrix. The recently introduced ICA blind source separation algorithm (Baram and Roth 1994; Bell and Sejnowski 1995) is a powerful and surprisingly simple technique for solving this problem. ICA is all the more remarkable for performing so well despite making absolutely no use of the temporal structure of its input! This paper presents a new algorithm, contextual ICA, which derives from a maximum likelihood density estimation formulation of the problem. cICA can incorporate arbitrarily complex adaptive history-sensitive source models, and thereby make use of the temporal structure of its input. This allows it to separate in a number of situations where standard ICA cannot, including sources with low kurtosis, colored gaussian sources, and sources which have gaussian histograms. Since ICA is a special case of cICA, the MLE derivation provides as a corollary a rigorous derivation of classic ICA. ",

    "text": "Title: Support Vector Machines: Training and Applications  \nAbstract: The Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a new and very promising classification technique developed by Vapnik and his group at AT&T Bell Laboratories [3, 6, 8, 24]. This new learning algorithm can be seen as an alternative training technique for Polynomial, Radial Basis Function and Multi-Layer Perceptron classifiers. The main idea behind the technique is to separate the classes with a surface that maximizes the margin between them. An interesting property of this approach is that it is an approximate implementation of the Structural Risk Minimization (SRM) induction principle [23]. The derivation of Support Vector Machines, its relationship with SRM, and its geometrical insight, are discussed in this paper. Since Structural Risk Minimization is an inductive principle that aims at minimizing a bound on the generalization error of a model, rather than minimizing the Mean Square Error over the data set (as Empirical Risk Minimization methods do), training a SVM to obtain the maximum margin classifier requires a different objective function. This objective function is then optimized by solving a large-scale quadratic programming problem with linear and box constraints. The problem is considered challenging, because the quadratic form is completely dense, so the memory needed to store the problem grows with the square of the number of data points. Therefore, training problems arising in some real applications with large data sets are impossible to load into memory, and cannot be solved using standard non-linear constrained optimization algorithms. We present a decomposition algorithm that can be used to train SVM's over large data sets. The main idea behind the decomposition is the iterative solution of sub-problems and the evaluation of, and also establish the stopping criteria for the algorithm. We present previous approaches, as well as results and important details of our implementation of the algorithm using a second-order variant of the Reduced Gradient Method as the solver of the sub-problems. As an application of SVM's, we present preliminary results in Frontal Human Face Detection in images. This application opens many interesting questions and future research opportunities, both in the context of faster and better optimization algorithms, and in the use of SVM's in other pattern classification, recognition, and detection applications.

It is shown that the well-known forward-backward (F-B) and Viterbi algorithms for HMMs are special cases of more general inference algorithms for arbitrary PINs. Furthermore, the existence of inference and estimation algorithms for more general graphical models provides a set of analysis tools for HMM practitioners who wish to explore a richer class of HMM structures.

The estimated probabilities above become quite noisy when the number of elements in set A m and B m are small. For this reason, we estimate the standard deviation of P m (*jffi). Notice that this estimate is the empirical average of a binomial variable (either a given couple satisfied the conditions on ffi and *, or it does not). The standard deviation is then estimated easily by: Generally speaking, P m (*jffi) increases with * (laxer output test), and when ffi approaches 0 (stricter input condition). Let us now define by P m (*) the maximum over ffi of P m (*jffi): P m (*) = max ffi&gt;0 P m (*jffi). The dependability index is defined as: P 0 (*) represents how much data passes the continuity test when no input information is available. This dependability index measures how much of the remaining continuity information is associated with involving input i m . This index is then averaged over * with respect to the probability (1 P 0 (*)): m (*) (1 P 0 (*)) d* (4.8) It is clear that m (*), and therefore its average, should be positive quantities. Furthermore, if the system is deterministic, the dependability is zero after a certain number of inputs, so the sum of averages saturates. If the system is also noise-free, they sum up to 1. For any m greater than the embedding dimension: refers to results obtained using this method. 4.6 Statistical variable selection Statistical variable selection (or feature selection) encompasses a number of techniques aimed at choosing a relevant subset of input variables in a regression or a classification problem. As in the rest of this document, we will limit ourselves to considerations related to the regression problem, even though most methods discussed below apply to classification as well. Variable selection can be seen as a part of the data analysis problem: the selection (or discard) of a variable tells us about the relevance of the associated measurement to the modelled system. In a general setting, this is a purely combinatorial problem: given V possible variables, there is 2 V possible subsets (including the empty set and the full set) of these variables. Given a performance measure, such as prediction error, the only optimal scheme is to test all these subset and choose the one that gives the best performance. It is easy to see that such an extensive scheme is only viable when the number of variables is rather low. Identifying 2 V models when we have more than a few variables requires too much computation. A number of techniques have been devised to overcome this combinatorial limit. Some of them use an iterative, locally optimal technique to construct an estimate of the relevant subset in a number of steps. We will refer to them as stepwise selection methods, not to be con fused with stepwise regression, a subset of these methods that we will address below. In forward selection, we start with an empty set of variables. At each step, we select a candidate variable using a selection criteria, check whether this variable should be added to the set, and iterate until a given stop condition is reached. On the contrary, backward elimination methods start with the full set of all input variables. At each step, the least significant variable is selected according to a selection criteria. If this variable is irrelevant, it is removed and the process is iterated until a stop condition is reached. It is easy to devise examples where the inclusion of a variable causes a previously included variable to become irrelevant. It thus seems appropriate to consider running a backward elimination each time a new variable is added by forward selection. This combination of both ap proaches is known as stepwise regression in the linear regression con",

In the case of a stochastic system, these tasks typically involve the use of a belief statea probability distribution over the state of the process at a given point in time. Unfortunately, the state spaces of complex processes are very large, making an explicit representation of a belief state intractable. Even in dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs), where the process itself can be represented compactly, the representation of the belief state is intractable. We investigate the idea of maintaining a compact approximation to the true belief state, and analyze the conditions under which the errors due to the approximations taken over the lifetime of the process do not accumulate to make our answers completely irrelevant. We show that the error in a belief state contracts exponentially as the process evolves. Thus, even with multiple approximations, the error in our process remains bounded indefinitely. We show how the additional structure of a DBN can be used to design our approximation scheme, improving its performance significantly. We demonstrate the applicability of our ideas in the context of a monitoring task, showing that orders of magnitude faster inference can be achieved with only a small degradation in accuracy.",

In this paper we present a technique called Addemup that uses genetic algorithms to directly search for an accurate and diverse set of trained networks. Addemup works by first creating an initial population, then uses genetic operators to continually create new networks, keeping the set of networks that are as accurate as possible while disagreeing with each other as much as possible. Experiments on three DNA problems show that Addemup is able to generate a set of trained networks that is more accurate than several existing approaches. Experiments also show that Addemup is able to effectively incorporate prior knowledge, if available, to improve the quality of its ensemble.",

The classification is based on simultaneously analyzing sixteen features measured from a patient.

However, the Markovian framework makes strong restrictive assumptions about the system generating the signalthat it is a single process having a small number of states and an extremely limited state memory.

In this paper, we explain how this \"overfitting\" really occurs, and show the surprising result that it can be overcome by selecting a hypothesis with a higher cross-validation error, over others with lower cross-validation errors. We give reasons for not selecting the hypothesis with the lowest cross-validation error, and propose a new algorithm, LOOCVCV, that uses a computa-tionally efficient form of leave-one-out cross-validation to select such a hypothesis.

This new model has been applied to the sorting network problem, a reference problem that challenged many computer scientists, and an original one-player game named Solitaire. For the first problem, the END model has been able to build from \"scratch\" some sorting networks as good as the best known for the 16-input problem. It even improved by one comparator a 25 years old result for the 13-input problem. For the Solitaire game, END evolved a strategy comparable to a human designed strategy. ",

To avoid the problem of exponentially large ANNs, we focus on Bayesian networks with noisy-or and noisy-and nodes.

The task is to use user-defined query to retrieve useful information, i.e., exact matches or partial matches which are close to query-defined request according to certain measures. The difficulty stems from the fact that it may not be easy (or it may be even impossible) to specify query requests precisely and completely resulting in a situation known as a fuzzy-querying. It is usually not a problem for small domains, but for a large repositories which store various information (multifunctional information bases or a federated databases), a request specification becomes a bottleneck. Thus, a flexible retrieval algorithm is required, allowing for imprecise query specification and for changing the viewpoint. Efficient database techniques exists for locating exact matches. Finding relevant partial matches might be a problem. This document proposes a context-based similarity as a basis for flexible retrieval. Historical bacground on research in similarity assessment is presented and is used as a motivation for formal definition of context-based similarity.

The model calibration task is the problem of training the free parameters of a scientific model in order to optimize the accuracy of the model for making future predictions. It is a form of supervised learning from examples in the presence of prior knowledge. An obvious approach to solving calibration problems is to formulate them as global optimization problems in which the goal is to find values for the free parameters that minimize the error of the model on training data. Unfortunately, this global optimization approach becomes computationally infeasible when the model is highly nonlinear. This paper presents a new divide-and-conquer method that analyzes the model to identify a series of smaller optimization problems whose sequential solution solves the global calibration problem. This paper argues that methods of this kind|rather than global optimization techniques|will be required in order for agents with large amounts of prior knowledge to learn efficiently. ",

In this approach, adaptation problems are initially solved by reasoning from scratch, using abstract rules about structural transformations and general memory search heuristics. Traces of the processing used for successful rule-based adaptation are stored as cases to enable future adaptation to be done by case-based reasoning. When similar adaptation problems are encountered in the future, these adaptation cases provide task- and domain-specific guidance for the case adaptation process. We present the tenets of the approach concerning the relationship between memory search and case adaptation, the memory search process, and the storage and reuse of cases representing adaptation episodes. These points are discussed in the context of ongoing research on DIAL, a computer model that learns case adaptation knowledge for case-based disaster response planning. ",

    "text": "Title: INFERENTIAL THEORY OF LEARNING: Developing Foundations for Multistrategy Learning  \nAbstract: The development of multistrategy learning systems should be based on a clear understanding of the roles and the applicability conditions of different learning strategies. To this end, this chapter introduces the Inferential Theory of Learning that provides a conceptual framework for explaining logical capabilities of learning strategies, i.e., their competence. Viewing learning as a process of modifying the learners knowledge by exploring the learners experience, the theory postulates that any such process can be described as a search in a knowledge space, triggered by the learners experience and guided by learning goals. The search operators are instantiations of knowledge transmutations, which are generic patterns of knowledge change. Transmutations may employ any basic type of inferencededuction, induction or analogy. Several fundamental knowledge transmutations are described in a novel and general way, such as generalization, abstraction, explanation and similization, and their counterparts, specialization, concretion, prediction and dissimilization, respectively. Generalization enlarges the reference set of a description (the set of entities that are being described). Abstraction reduces the amount of the detail about the reference set. Explanation generates premises that explain (or imply) the given properties of the reference set. Similization transfers knowledge from one reference set to a similar reference set. Using concepts of the theory, a multistrategy task-adaptive learning (MTL) methodology is outlined, and illustrated b y an example. MTL dynamically adapts strategies to the learning task, defined by the input information, learners background knowledge, and the learning goal. It aims at synergistically integrating a whole range of inferential learning strategies, such as empirical generalization, constructive induction, deductive generalization, explanation, prediction, abstraction, and similization.

The problem with small disjuncts is that they are more error prone than large disjuncts, but may be necessary to achieve a high level of predictive accuracy [Holte, Acker, and Porter, 1989]. This paper extends previous work done on the problem of small disjuncts by taking noise into account. It investigates the assertion that it is hard to learn from noisy data because it is difficult to distinguish between noise and true exceptions. In the process of evaluating this assertion, insights are gained into the mechanisms by which noise affects learning. Two domains are investigated. The experimental results in this paper suggest that for both Shapiro's chess endgame domain [Shapiro, 1987] and for the Wisconsin breast cancer domain [Wolberg, 1990], the assertion is true, at least for low levels (5-10%) of class noise.

The EASI algorithms are based on the idea of serial updating: this specific form of matrix updates systematically yields algorithms with a simple, parallelizable structure, for both real and complex mixtures. Most importantly, the performance of an EASI algorithm does not depend on the mixing matrix. In particular, convergence rates, stability conditions and interference rejection levels depend only on the (normalized) distributions of the source signals. Close form expressions of these quantities are given via an asymptotic performance analysis. This is completed by some numerical experiments illustrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Procedures of this type were called arcing by Breiman[1996]. The first successful arcing procedure was introduced by Freund and Schapire[1995,1996] and called Adaboost. In an effort to explain why Adaboost works, Schapire et.al. [1997] derived a bound on the generalization error of a convex combination of classifiers in terms of the margin. We introduce a function called the edge, which differs from the margin only if there are more than two classes. A framework for understanding arcing algorithms is defined. In this framework, we see that the arcing algorithms currently in the literature are optimization algorithms which minimize some function of the edge. A relation is derived between the optimal reduction in the maximum value of the edge and the PAC concept of weak learner. Two algorithms are described which achieve the optimal reduction. Tests on both synthetic and real data cast doubt on the Schapire et.al. There is recent empirical evidence that significant reductions in generalization error can be gotten by growing a number of different classifiers on the same training set and letting these vote for the best class. Freund and Schapire ([1995], [1996] ) proposed an algorithm called AdaBoost which adaptively reweights the training set in a way based on the past history of misclassifications, constructs a new classifier using the current weights, and uses the misclassification rate of this classifier to determine the size of its vote. In a number of empirical studies on many data sets using trees (CART or C4.5) as the base classifier (Drucker and Cortes[1995], Quinlan[1996], Freud and Schapire[1996], Breiman[1996]) AdaBoost produced dramatic decreases in generalization error compared to using a single tree. Error rates were reduced to the point where tests on some well-known data sets gave the result that CART plus AdaBoost did significantly better than any other of the commonly used classification methods (Breiman[1996] ). Meanwhile, empirical results showed that other methods of adaptive resampling (or reweighting) and combining (called \"arcing\" by Breiman [1996]) also led to low test set error rates. An algorithm called arc-x4 (Breiman[1996]) gave error rates almost identical to Adaboost. Ji and Ma[1997] worked with classifiers consisting of randomly selected hyperplanes and using a different method of adaptive resampling and unweighted voting, also got low error rates. Thus, there are a least three arcing algorithms extant, all of which give excellent classification accuracy. explanation.",

The main advantage of this single chromosome representation is in analogy to the permutation scheme of the traveling salesman problem (TSP) that it cannot produce illegal sets of operation sequences (infeasible symbolic solutions). As a consequence of the representation scheme a new crossover operator preserving the initial scheme structure of permutations with repetition will be sketched. Its behavior is similar to the well known Order-Crossover for simple permutation schemes. Actually the GOX operator for permutations with repetition arises from a Generalisation of OX. Computational experiments show, that GOX passes the information from a couple of parent solutions efficiently to offspring solutions. Together, the new representation and GOX support the cooperative aspect of the genetic search for scheduling problems strongly. ",

Although the inferences that can be drawn from a reasoner's knowledge and from available inputs is very large (potentially infinite), the inferential resources available to any reasoning system are limited. With limited inferential capacity and very many potential inferences, reasoners must somehow control the process of inference. Not all inferences are equally useful to a given reasoning system. Any reasoning system that has goals (or any form of a utility function) and acts based on its beliefs indirectly assigns utility to its beliefs. Given limits on the process of inference, and variation in the utility of inferences, it is clear that a reasoner ought to draw the inferences that will be most valuable to it. This paper presents an approach to this problem that makes the utility of a (potential) belief an explicit part of the inference process. The method is to generate explicit desires for knowledge. The question of focus of attention is thereby transformed into two related problems: How can explicit desires for knowledge be used to control inference and facilitate resource-constrained goal pursuit in general? and, Where do these desires for knowledge come from? We present a theory of knowledge goals, or desires for knowledge, and their use in the processes of understanding and learning. The theory is illustrated using two case studies, a natural language understanding program that learns by reading novel or unusual newspaper stories, and a differential diagnosis program that improves its accuracy with experience.

Recent work in AI has dealt with the issue of using past explanations stored in the reasoner's memory to understand novel situations. However, this process assumes that past explanations are well understood and provide good \"lessons\" to be used for future situations. This assumption is usually false when one is learning about a novel domain, since situations encountered previously in this domain might not have been understood completely. Instead, it is reasonable to assume that the reasoner would have gaps in its knowledge base. By reasoning about a new situation, the reasoner should be able to fill in these gaps as new information came in, reorganize its explanations in memory, and gradually evolve a better understanding of its domain. We present a story understanding program that retrieves past explanations from situations already in memory, and uses them to build explanations to understand novel stories about terrorism. In doing so, the system refines its understanding of the domain by filling in gaps in these explanations, by elaborating the explanations, or by learning new indices for the explanations. This is a type of incremental learning since the system improves its explanatory knowledge of the domain in an incremental fashion rather than by learning new XPs as a whole.",

    "text": "Title: MultiPlayer Residual Advantage Learning With General Function Approximation  \nAbstract: A new algorithm, advantage learning, is presented that improves on advantage updating by requiring that a single function be learned rather than two. Furthermore, advantage learning requires only a single type of update, the learning update, while advantage updating requires two different types of updates, a learning update and a normilization update. The reinforcement learning system uses the residual form of advantage learning. An application of reinforcement learning to a Markov game is presented. The testbed has continuous states and nonlinear dynamics. The game consists of two players, a missile and a plane; the missile pursues the plane and the plane evades the missile. On each time step , each player chooses one of two possible actions; turn left or turn right, resulting in a 90 degree instantaneous change in the aircraft s heading. Reinforcement is given only when the missile hits the plane or the plane reaches an escape distance from the missile. The advantage function is stored in a single-hidden-layer sigmoidal network. Speed of learning is increased by a new algorithm , Incremental Delta-Delta (IDD), which extends Jacobs (1988) Delta-Delta for use in incremental training, and differs from Suttons Incremental Delta-Bar-Delta (1992) in that it does not require the use of a trace and is amenable for use with general function approximation systems. The advantage learning algorithm for optimal control is modified for games in order to find the minimax point, rather than the maximum. Empirical results gathered using the missile/aircraft testbed validate theory that suggests residual forms of reinforcement learning algorithms converge to a local minimum of the mean squared Bellman residual when using general function approximation systems. Also, to our knowledge, this is the first time an approximate second order method has been used with residual algorithms. Empirical results are presented comparing convergence rates with and without the use of IDD for the reinforcement learning testbed described above and for a supervised learning testbed. The results of these experiments demonstrate IDD increased the rate of convergence and resulted in an order of magnitude lower total asymptotic error than when using backpropagation alone. ",

Here a learning curve can be defined to be the expected error of a learner's hypotheses as a function of training sample size. Haussler, Littlestone and Warmuth have shown that, in the distribution free setting, the smallest expected error a learner can achieve in the worst case over a concept class C converges rationally to zero error (i.e., fi(1=t) for training sample size t). However, recently Cohn and Tesauro have demonstrated how exponential convergence can often be observed in experimental settings (i.e., average error decreasing as e fi(t) ). By addressing a simple non-uniformity in the original analysis, this paper shows how the dichotomy between rational and exponential worst case learning curves can be recovered in the distribution free theory. These results support the experimental findings of Cohn and Tesauro: for finite concept classes, any consistent learner achieves exponential convergence, even in the worst case; but for continuous concept classes, no learner can exhibit sub-rational convergence for every target concept and domain distribution. A precise boundary between rational and exponential convergence is drawn for simple concept chains. Here we show that somewhere dense chains always force rational convergence in the worst case, but exponential convergence can always be achieved for nowhere dense chains.",

This paper proposes a novel, evolutionary approach to data clustering and classification which overcomes many of the limitations of traditional systems. The approach rests on the optimisation of both the number and positions of fuzzy prototypes using a real-valued genetic algorithm (GA). Because the GA acts on all of the classes at once, the system benefits naturally from global information about possible class interactions. In addition, the concept of a receptive field for each prototype is used to replace the classical distance-based membership function by an infinite fuzzy support, multidimensional, Gaussian function centred over the prototype and with unique variance in each dimension, reflecting the tightness of the cluster. Hence, the notion of nearest-neighbour is replaced by that of nearest attracting prototype (NAP). The proposed model is a completely self-optimising, fuzzy system called GA-NAP. Most data clustering algorithms, including the popular K-means algorithm, require a priori knowledge about the problem domain to fix the number and starting positions of the prototypes. Although such knowledge may be assumed for domains whose dimensionality is fairly small or whose underlying structure is relatively intuitive, it is clearly much less accessible in hyper-dimensional settings, where the number of input parameters may be very large. Classical systems also suffer from the fact that they can only define clusters for one class at a time. Hence, no account is made of potential interactions among classes. These drawbacks are further compounded by the fact that the ensuing classification is typically based on a fixed, distance-based membership function for all prototypes. This paper proposes a novel approach to data clustering and classification which overcomes the aforementioned limitations of traditional systems. The model is based on the genetic evolution of fuzzy prototypes. A real-valued genetic algorithm (GA) is used to optimise both the number and positions of prototypes. Because the GA acts on all of the classes at once and measures fitness as classification accuracy, the system naturally profits from global information about class interaction. The concept of a receptive field for each prototype is also presented and used to replace the classical, fixed distance-based function by an infinite fuzzy support membership function. The new membership function is inspired by that used in the hidden layer of RBF networks. It consists of a multidimensional Gaussian function centred over the prototype and with a unique variance in each dimension that reflects the tightness of the cluster. During classification, the notion of nearest-neighbour is replaced by that of nearest attracting prototype (NAP). The proposed model is a completely self-optimising, fuzzy system called GA-NAP. ",

A simple model of coevolution was implemented with the addition of genes for longevity and mutation rate in the individuals. This made it possible for a lineage to evolve to be immortal. It also allowed the evolution of no mutation or extremely high mutation rates. The model shows that when the individuals interact in a sort of zero-sum game, the lineages maintain relatively high mutation rates. However, when individuals engage in interactions that have greater consequences for one individual in the interaction than the other, lineages tend to evolve relatively low mutation rates. This model suggests that different genes may have evolved different mutation rates as adaptations to the varying pressures of interactions with other genes. ",

This basic approach suffers from three drawbacks: com-putationally expensive prediction when the database grows large, overfitting in the presence of noisy data, and sensitivity to the selection of a proper distance function. We address all these issues by giving a probabilistic interpretation to instance-based learning, where the goal is to approximate predictive distributions of the attributes of interest.

However, it is not clear whether there are elusive and esoteric similarity measures which might improve the performance of a case-based reasoner if substituted for the more commonly used measures. This paper therefore deals with the problem of choosing the best similarity measure, in the limited context of instance-based learning of classifications of a discrete example space. We consider both `fixed' similarity measures and `learnt' ones. In the former case, we give a definition of a similarity measure which we believe to be `optimal' w.r.t. the current prior distribution of target concepts and prove its optimality within a restricted class of similarity measures. We then show how this `optimal' similarity measure is instantiated by some specific prior distributions, and conclude that a very simple similarity measure is as good as any other in these cases.

There are many examples of natural and artificial systems which show that a modular approach can reduce the total complexity of the system while solving a difficult problem satisfactorily. The success of modular artificial neural networks in speech and image processing is a typical example. However, designing a modular system is a difficult task. It relies heavily on human experts and prior knowledge about the problem. There is no systematic and automatic way to form a modular system for a problem. This paper proposes a novel evolutionary learning approach to designing a modular system automatically, without human intervention. Our starting point is speciation, using a technique based on fitness sharing. While speciation in genetic algorithms is not new, no effort has been made towards using a speciated population as a complete modular system. We harness the specialized expertise in the species of an entire population, rather than a single individual, by introducing a gating algorithm. We demonstrate our approach to automatic modularization by improving co-evolutionary game learning. Following earlier researchers, we learn to play iterated prisoner's dilemma. We review some problems of earlier co-evolutionary learning, and explain their poor generalization ability and sudden mass extinctions. The generalization ability of our approach is significantly better than past efforts. Using the specialized expertise of the entire speciated population though a gating algorithm, instead of the best individual, is the main contributor to this improvement. ",

Information about the probability that conditions will remain satisfied minimizes demands on sensing, as does knowledge about the durations of states and their likely successors. Three statistical learning methods let the system gradually reduce sensory load as it gains experience in a domain.

For recurrent neural networks no general methods exist that permit the estimation of the number of layers of hidden neurons, the size of layers or the number of weights. We present a simple pruning heuristic which significantly improves the generalization performance of trained recurrent networks. We illustrate this heuristic by training a fully recurrent neural network on positive and negative strings of a regular grammar. We also show that if rules are extracted from networks trained to recognize these strings, that rules extracted after pruning are more consistent with the rules to be learned. This performance improvement is obtained by pruning and retraining the networks. Simulations are shown for training and pruning a recurrent neural net on strings generated by two regular grammars, a randomly-generated 10-state grammar and an 8-state triple parity grammar. Further simulations indicate that this pruning method can gives generalization performance superior to that obtained by training with weight decay.",

In particular, we characterize the essential aspects of a model selection task by the bias and variance profiles it generates over the sequence of hypothesis classes. With this view, we develop a new understanding of complexity-penalization methods: First, the penalty terms can be interpreted as postulating a particular profile for the variances as a function of model complexityif the postulated and true profiles do not match, then systematic under-fitting or over-fitting results, depending on whether the penalty terms are too large or too small. Second, we observe that it is generally best to penalize according to the true variances of the task, and therefore no fixed penalization strategy is optimal across all problems. We then use this characterization to introduce the notion of easy versus hard model selection problems. Here we show that if the variance profile grows too rapidly in relation to the biases, then standard model selection techniques become prone to significant errors. This can happen, for example, in regression problems where the independent variables are drawn from wide-tailed distributions. To counter this, we discuss a new model selection strategy that dramatically outperforms standard complexity-penalization and hold-out meth ods on these hard tasks.",

This paper is concerned with derivation replay, which is the main component of a form of case-based planning called derivational analogy (DA). Prior to this study, implementations of derivation replay have been based within state-space planning. We are motivated by the acknowledged superiority of partial-order (PO) planners in plan generation. Here we demonstrate that plan-space planning also has an advantage in replay. We will argue that the decoupling of planning (derivation) order and the execution order of plan steps, provided by partial-order planners, enables them to exploit the guidance of previous cases in a more efficient and straightforward fashion. We validate our hypothesis through a focused empirical comparison. ",

So a major step in data engineering for inductive learning is the construction of good features by domain experts. These features often represent properties of structured objects, where a property typically is the occurrence of a certain substructure having certain properties. To partly automate the process of \"feature engineering\", we devised an algorithm that searches for features which are defined by such substructures. The algorithm stochastically conducts a top-down search for first-order clauses, where each clause represents a binary feature. It differs from existing algorithms in that its search is not class-blind, and that it is capable of considering clauses (\"context\") of almost arbitrary length (size). Preliminary experiments are favorable, and support the view that this approach is promising.",

Our goal is to develop a classification algorithm which is stable in terms of applicability in different geographical regions. Unlike optical remote sensing techniques, radar remote sensing can provide calibrated data where the image signal is solely determined by the physical (structural) and electrical properties of the targets on the Earth's surface and near subsurface. Hence, a classifier based on radar signatures of object classes should be applicable on new calibrated images without the need to train the classifier again. This article discusses the design and applicability of a classification algorithm, which is based on calibrated radar signatures measured from ERS-1 (C-band, vv polarized) and JERS-1 (L-band, hh polarized) SAR image data. The applicability is compared in two different test sites, Raco, Michigan and the Cedar Creek LTER site, Minnesota.

Kritik autonomously generated preliminary (conceptual, qualitative) designs for physical devices by retrieving and adapting past designs stored in its case memory. Each case in the system had an associated structure-behavior-function (SBF) device model that explained how the structure of the device accomplished its functions. These casespecific device models guided the process of modifying a past design to meet the functional specification of a new design problem. The device models also enabled verification of the design modifications. Kritik2 is a new and more complete implementation of Kritik. In this paper, we take a retrospective view on Kritik. In early papers, we had described Kritik as integrating case-based and model-based reasoning. In this integration, Kritik also grounds the computational process of case-based reasoning in the SBF content theory of device comprehension. The SBF models not only provide methods for many specific tasks in case-based design such as design adaptation and verification, but they also provide the vocabulary for the whole process of case-based design, from retrieval of old cases to storage of new ones. This grounding, we believe, is essential for building well-constrained theories of case-based design. ",

The need for coordination arises because agents have to share resources and expertise required to achieve their goals. Previous work in the area includes using sophisticated information exchange protocols, investigating heuristics for negotiation, and developing formal models of possibilities of conflict and cooperation among agent interests. In order to handle the changing requirements of continuous and dynamic environments, we propose learning as a means to provide additional possibilities for effective coordination. We use reinforcement learning techniques on a block pushing problem to show that agents can learn complimentary policies to follow a desired path without any knowledge about each other. We theoretically analyze and experimentally verify the effects of learning rate on system convergence, and demonstrate benefits of using learned coordination knowledge on similar problems. Reinforcement learning based coordination can be achieved in both cooperative and non-cooperative domains, and in domains with noisy communication channels and other stochastic characteristics that present a formidable challenge to using other coordination schemes.

Under the distributed output code developed by Sejnowski and Rosenberg, it is shown that BP consistently out-performs ID3 on this task by several percentage points. Three hypotheses explaining this difference were explored: (a) ID3 is overfitting the training data, (b) BP is able to share hidden units across several output units and hence can learn the output units better, and (c) BP captures statistical information that ID3 does not. We conclude that only hypothesis (c) is correct. By augmenting ID3 with a simple statistical learning procedure, the performance of BP can be approached but not matched. More complex statistical procedures can improve the performance of both BP and ID3 substantially. A study of the residual errors suggests that there is still substantial room for improvement in learning methods for text-to-speech mapping.",

This paper shows that (a) additional sensation from another agent is beneficial if it can be used efficiently, (b) sharing learned policies or episodes among agents speeds up learning at the cost of communication, and (c) for joint tasks, agents engaging in partnership can significantly outperform independent agents although they may learn slowly in the beginning.

In this paper we present a knowledge-level analysis of redesign. Redesign is viewed as a family of methods based on some common principles, and a number of dimensions along which redesign problem solving methods can vary are distinguished. By examining the problem-solving behavior of a number of existing redesign systems and approaches, we came up with a collection of problem-solving methods for redesign and developed a task-method structure for redesign. In constructing a system for redesign a large number of knowledge-related choices and decisions are made. In order to describe all relevant choices in redesign problem solving, we have to extend the current notion of possible relations between tasks and methods in a PSM architecture. The realization of a task by a problem-solving method, and the decomposition of a problem-solving method into subtasks are the most common relations in a PSM architecture. However, we suggest to extend these relations with the notions of task refinement and method refinement. These notions represent intermediate decisions in a task-method structure, in which the competence of a task or method is refined without immediately paying attention to its operationalization in terms of subtasks. Explicit representation of this kind of intermediate decisions helps to make and represent decisions in a more piecemeal fashion. ",

We apply our technique to solve an open problem of Maass and Turan [18], showing that for any concept class F , the least number of queries sufficient for learning F by an algorithm which has access only to arbitrary equivalence queries is at most a factor of 1= log 2 (4=3) more than the least number of queries sufficient for learning F by an algorithm which has access to both arbitrary equivalence queries and membership queries. Previously known results imply that the 1= log 2 (4=3) in our bound is best possible. We describe analogous results for two generalizations of this model to function learning, and apply those results to bound the difficulty of learning in the harder of these models in terms of the difficulty of learning in the easier model. We bound the difficulty of learning unions of k concepts from a class F in terms of the difficulty of learning F . We bound the difficulty of learning in a noisy environment for deterministic algorithms in terms of the difficulty of learning in a noise-free environment. We apply a variant of our technique to develop an algorithm transformation that allows probabilistic learning algorithms to nearly optimally cope with noise. A second variant enables us to improve a general lower bound of Turan [19] for the PAC-learning model (with queries). Finally, we show that logarithmically many membership queries never help to obtain computationally efficient learning algorithms. fl Supported by Air Force Office of Scientific Research grant F49620-92-J-0515.

This paper extends earlier results on adaptive control and estimation of nonlinear systems using gaussian radial basis functions to the on-line generation of irregularly sampled networks, using tools from multiresolution analysis and wavelet theory. This yields much more compact and efficient system representations while preserving global closed-loop stability. Approximation models employing basis functions that are localized in both space and spatial frequency admit a measure of the approximated function's spatial frequency content that is not directly dependent on reconstruction error. As a result, these models afford a means of adaptively selecting basis functions according to the local spatial frequency content of the approximated function. An algorithm for stable, on-line adaptation of output weights simultaneously with node configuration in a class of non-parametric models with wavelet basis functions is presented. An asymptotic bound on the error in the network's reconstruction is derived and shown to be dependent solely on the minimum approximation error associated with the steady state node configuration. In addition, prior bounds on the temporal bandwidth of the system to be identified or controlled are used to develop a criterion for on-line selection of radial and ridge wavelet basis functions, thus reducing the rate of increase in network's size with the dimension of the state vector. Experimental results obtained by using the network to predict the path of an unknown light bluff object thrown through air, in an active-vision based robotic catching system, are given to illustrate the network's performance in a simple real-time application.

During testing of a machine learning algorithm (foil) on new databases of prokaryotic RNA transcription promoters which we have developed, cross-validation displayed an interesting phenomenon. One theory is found repeatedly and is responsible for very little of the cross-validation error, whereas other theories are found very infrequently which tend to be responsible for the majority of the cross-validation error. It is tempting to believe that the most frequently found theory (the \"modal theory\") may be more accurate as a classifier of unseen data than the other theories. However, experiments showed that modal theories are not more accurate on unseen data than the other theories found less frequently during cross-validation. Modal theories may be useful in predicting when cross-validation is a poor estimate of true accuracy.

Control theory helps when linear controllers have to be developed, but it doesn't sufficiently support the generation of non-linear controllers, although in many cases (such as in compliance control), nonlinear control is essential for achieving high performance. This paper discusses how Machine Learning has been applied to the design of (non-)linear controllers. Several alternative function approximators, including Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP), Radial Basis Function Networks (RBFNs), and Fuzzy Controllers are analyzed and compared, leading to the definition of two major families: Open Field Function Function Approximators and Locally Receptive Field Function Approximators. It is shown that RBFNs and Fuzzy Controllers bear strong similarities, and that both have a symbolic interpretation. This characteristics allows for applying both symbolic and statistic learning algorithms to synthesize the network layout from a set of examples and, possibly, some background knowledge. Three integrated learning algorithms, two of which are original, are described and evaluated on experimental test cases. The first test case is provided by a robot KUKA IR-361 engaged into the \"peg-into-hole\" task, whereas the second is represented by a classical prediction task on the Mackey-Glass time series. From the experimental comparison, it appears that both Fuzzy Controllers and RBFNs synthesised from examples are excellent approximators, and that, in practice, they can be even more accurate than MLPs.

Heuristic measures mostly assume independence of attributes so their use is non-optimal in domains with strong dependencies between attributes. For the same reason they are also mostly unable to recognize context dependent features. Relief and its extension Re-liefF are statistical methods capable of correctly estimating the quality of attributes in classification problems with strong dependencies between attributes. By exploiting local information provided by different contexts they provide a global view and recognize contextual attributes. After the analysis of ReliefF we have extended it to continuous class problems. Regressional ReliefF (RReliefF) and ReliefF provide a unified view on estimating attribute quality. The experiments show that RReliefF correctly estimates the quality of attributes, recognizes the contextual attributes and can be used for non myopic learning of the regression trees.",

In this framework, it is then possible to learn with incomplete information about the examples by exploiting the hypothetical reasoning of abduction. The paper presents the basic framework of ACL with its main characteristics and illustrates its potential in addressing several problems in ILP such as learning with incomplete information and multiple predicate learning. An algorithm for ACL is developed by suitably extending the top-down ILP method for concept learning and integrating this with an abductive proof procedure for Abductive Logic Programming (ALP). A prototype system has been developed and applied to learning problems with incomplete information. The particular role of integrity constraints in ACL is investigated showing ACL as a hybrid learning framework that integrates the explanatory (discriminant) and descriptive (characteristic) settings of ILP.",

Memories are stored in a dynamical attractor that is a continuous manifold of fixed points, as illustrated by linear and nonlinear networks with hidden neurons. Pattern analysis and synthesis are forms of pattern completion by recall of a stored memory. Analysis and synthesis in the linear network are performed by bottom-up and top-down connections. In the nonlinear network, the analysis computation additionally requires rectification nonlinearity and inner product inhibition between hidden neurons. One popular approach to sensory processing is based on generative models, which assume that sensory input patterns are synthesized from some underlying hidden variables. For example, the sounds of speech can be synthesized from a sequence of phonemes, and images of a face can be synthesized from pose and lighting variables. Hidden variables are useful because they constitute a simpler representation of the variables that are visible in the sensory input. Using a generative model for sensory processing requires a method of pattern analysis. Given a sensory input pattern, analysis is the recovery of the hidden variables from which it was synthesized. In other words, analysis and synthesis are inverses of each other. There are a number of approaches to pattern analysis. In analysis-by-synthesis, the synthetic model is embedded inside a negative feedback loop[1]. Another approach is to construct a separate analysis model[2]. This paper explores a third approach, in which visible-hidden pairs are embedded as attractive fixed points, or attractors, in the state space of a recurrent neural network. The attractors can be regarded as memories stored in the network, and analysis and synthesis as forms of pattern completion by recall of a memory. The approach is illustrated with linear and nonlinear network architectures. In both networks, the synthetic model is linear, as in principal ",

It was believed that this goal would indirectly achieve a high degree of predictive accuracy on a set of test data. Later research has partially disproved this belief. However, the issue of consistency has not yet been resolved completely. We examine the issue of consistency from a new perspective. To avoid overfitting the training data, a considerable number of current systems have sacrificed the goal of learning hypotheses that are perfectly consistent with the training instances by setting a goal of hypothesis simplicity (Occam's razor). Instead of using simplicity as a goal, we have developed a novel approach that addresses consistency directly. In other words, our concept learner has the explicit goal of selecting the most appropriate degree of consistency with the training data. We begin this paper by exploring concept learning with less than perfect consistency. Next, we describe a system that can adapt its degree of consistency in response to feedback about predictive accuracy on test data. Finally, we present the results of initial experiments that begin to address the question of how tightly hypotheses should fit the training data for different problems. ",

We propose the use of auxiliary simulations to estimate the numerical values needed in Rosenthal's theorem. Our simulation method makes it possible to compute quantitative convergence bounds for models for which the requisite analytical computations would be prohibitively difficult or impossible. On the other hand, although our method appears to perform well in our example problems, it can not provide the guarantees offered by analytical proof. Acknowledgements.

Basically, those techniques iteratively sample the search space with respect to a probability distribution which is updated according to the result of previous samples and some predefined strategy.

However, it addresses a class of problems for which it is difficult to design transformation operators to perform local search because of intrinsic constraints in the definition of the problem itself. For those problems, a procedural approach is the natural way to construct solutions, resulting in a state space represented as a tree or a DAG. The aim of this paper is to describe the underlying heuristics used by SAGE to address problems belonging to that class.

Yet, we also know that no search method is better than another over all possible problems and that in fact there is often a good deal of problem specific information involved in the choice of problem representation and search operators. In this paper we explore some very general properties of representations as they relate to neighborhood search methods. In particular, we looked at the expected number of local optima under a neighborhood search operator when averaged overall possible representations. The number of local optima under a neighborhood search operator for standard Binary and standard binary reflected Gray codes is developed and explored as one measure of problem complexity. We also relate number of local optima to another metric, , designed to provide one measure of complexity with respect to a simple genetic algorithm. Choosing a good representation is a vital component of solving any search problem. However, choosing a good representation for a problem is as difficult as choosing a good search algorithm for a problem. Wolpert and Macready's (1995) No Free Lunch (NFL) theorem proves that no search algorithm is better than any other over all possible discrete functions. Radcliffe and Surry (1995) extend these notions to also cover the idea that all representations are equivalent when their behavior is considered on average over all possible functions. To understand these results, we first outline some of the simple assumptions behind this theorem. First, assume the optimization problem is discrete; this describes all combinatorial optimization problems-and really all optimization problems being solved on computers since computers have finite precision. Second, we ignore the fact that we can resample points in the space. The \"No Free Lunch\" result can be stated as follows: ",

However, behavioral limitations of CCBR motivate the search for integrations with other reasoning approaches. This paper briefly describes our group's ongoing efforts towards enhancing the inferencing behaviors of a conversational case-based reasoning development tool named NaCoDAE. In particular, we focus on integrating NaCoDAE with machine learning, model-based reasoning, and generative planning modules. This paper defines CCBR, briefly summarizes the integrations, and explains how they enhance the overall system. Our research focuses on enhancing the performance of conversational case-based reasoning (CCBR) systems (Aha & Breslow, 1997). CCBR is a form of case-based reasoning where users initiate problem solving conversations by entering an initial problem description in natural language text. This text is assumed to be a partial rather than a complete problem description. The CCBR system then assists in eliciting refinements of this description and in suggesting solutions. Its primary purpose is to provide a focus of attention for the user so as to quickly provide a solution(s) for their problem. Figure 1 summarizes the CCBR problem solving cycle.

In order to facilitate this goal, agents are run through random environment configurations. Randomly generated programs, which control the interaction of the agent with its environment, are recombined to form better programs. Each generation of the population of agents is placed into the Simulator with the ultimate goal of producing an agent capable of surviving any environment. The environment that an agent is presented consists of other agents, mines, and energy. The goal of this research is to construct a program which when executed will allow an agent (or agents) to correctly sense, and mark, the presence of items (energy and mines) in any environment. The Simulator determines the raw fitness of each agent by interpreting the associated program. General programs are evolved to solve this problem. Different environmental setups are presented to show the generality of the solution. These environments include one agent in a fixed environment, one agent in a fluctuating environment, and multiple agents in a fluctuating environment cooperating together. The genetic programming technique was extremely successful. The average fitness per generation in all three environments tested showed steady improvement. Programs were successfully generated that enabled an agent to handle any possible environment. ",

We propose and analyze a new learning algorithm to solve a certain class of non-Markov decision problems. Our algorithm applies to problems in which the environment is Markov, but the learner has restricted access to state information. The algorithm involves a Monte-Carlo policy evaluation combined with a policy improvement method that is similar to that of Markov decision problems and is guaranteed to converge to a local maximum. The algorithm operates in the space of stochastic policies, a space which can yield a policy that performs considerably better than any deterministic policy. Although the space of stochastic policies is continuous|even for a discrete action space|our algorithm is computationally tractable. ",

Adaptive control seems the only alternative. We have begun building an adaptive control system that can infer appropriate rules of operation for home comfort systems based on the lifestyle of the inhabitants and energy conservation goals.

First is the robot's ability to learn a representation of the local environment and use this representation to identify which local environment it is in. This is done by first extracting features from the sensors which are more informative than just distances of obstacles in various directions. Using these features a reduced ring representation (RRR) of the local environment is derived. As the robot navigates, it learns the RRR signatures of all the new environment types it encounters. For purpose of identification, a ring matching criteria is proposed where the robot tries to match the RRR from the sensory input to one of the RRRs in its library. The second issue addressed is that of learning hill climbing control laws in the local environments. Unlike conventional neuro-controllers, a reinforcement learning framework, where the robot first learns a model of the environment and then learns the control law in terms of a neural network is proposed here. The reinforcement function is generated from the sensory inputs of the robot before and after a control action is taken. Three key results shown in this work are that (1) The robot is able to build its library of RRR signatures perfectly even with significant sensor noise for eight different local environ-mets, (2) It was able to identify its local environment with an accuracy of more than 96%, once the library is build, and (3) the robot was able to learn adequate hill climbing control laws which take it to the distinctive state of the local environment for five different environment types.",

Next, the development of connectionist research is traced, commencing with connectionism's philosophical predecessors, moving to early psychological and neuropsychological influences, followed by the mathematical and computing contributions to connectionist research.

Canonical momenta are thereby derived and used as technical indicators in a recursive ASA optimization process to tune trading rules. These trading rules are then used on out-of-sample data, to demonstrate that they can profit from the SMFM model, to illustrate that these markets are likely not efficient. This methodology can be extended to other systems, e.g., electroencephalography.

Simulated annealing | moving from a tractable distribution to a distribution of interest via a sequence of intermediate distributions | has traditionally been used as an inexact method of handling isolated modes in Markov chain samplers. Here, it is shown how one can use the Markov chain transitions for such an annealing sequence to define an importance sampler. The Markov chain aspect allows this method to perform acceptably even for high-dimensional problems, where finding good importance sampling distributions would otherwise be very difficult, while the use of importance weights ensures that the estimates found converge to the correct values as the number of annealing runs increases. This annealed importance sampling procedure resembles the second half of the previously-studied tempered transitions, and can be seen as a generalization of a recently-proposed variant of sequential importance sampling. It is also related to thermodynamic integration methods for estimating ratios of normalizing constants. Annealed importance sampling is most attractive when isolated modes are present, or when estimates of normalizing constants are required, but it may also be more generally useful, since its independent sampling allows one to bypass some of the problems of assessing convergence and autocorrelation in Markov chain samplers.

A previous paper has established the first theory of the statistical mechanics of combat (SMC), developed using modern methods of statistical mechanics, baselined to empirical data gleaned from the National Training Center (NTC). This previous project has also established a JANUS(T)-NTC computer simulation/wargame of NTC, providing a statistical ``what-if '' capability for NTC scenarios. This mathematical formulation is ripe for control-theoretic extension to include human factors, a methodology previously developed in the context of teleoperated vehicles. Similar NTC scenarios differing at crucial decision points will be used for data to model the inuence of decision making on combat. The results may then be used to improve present human factors and C 2 algorithms in computer simulations/wargames. Our approach is to ``subordinate'' the SMC nonlinear stochastic equations, fitted to NTC scenarios, to establish the zeroth order description of that combat. In practice, an equivalent mathematical-physics representation is used, more suitable for numerical and formal work, i.e., a Lagrangian representation. Theoretically, these equations are nested within a larger set of nonlinear stochastic operator-equations which include C 3 human factors, e.g., supervisory decisions. In this study, we propose to perturb this operator theory about the SMC zeroth order set of equations. Then, subsets of scenarios fit to zeroth order, originally considered to be similarly degenerate, can be further split perturbatively to distinguish C 3 decision-making inuences. New methods of Very Fast Simulated Re-Annealing (VFSR), developed in the previous project, will be used for fitting these models to empirical data. ",

To choose effectively where to spend a costly planning step, classic prioritized sweeping uses a simple heuristic to focus computation on the states that are likely to have the largest errors. In this paper, we introduce generalized prioritized sweeping, a principled method for generating such estimates in a representation-specific manner. This allows us to extend prioritized sweeping beyond an explicit, state-based representation to deal with compact representations that are necessary for dealing with large state spaces. We apply this method for generalized model approximators (such as Bayesian networks), and describe preliminary experiments that compare our approach with classical prioritized sweeping. ",

Because the cut predicate has only a procedural meaning, clauses containing cut cannot be learned using an extensional evaluation method, as is done in most learning systems. On the other hand, searching a space of possible programs (instead of a space of independent clauses) is unfeasible. An alternative solution is to generate first a candidate base program which covers the positive examples, and then make it consistent by inserting cut where appropriate. The problem of learning programs with cut has not been investigated before and this seems to be a natural and reasonable approach. We generalize this scheme and investigate the difficulties that arise. Some of the major shortcomings are actually caused, in general, by the need for intensional evaluation. As a conclusion, the analysis of this paper suggests, on precise and technical grounds, that learning cut is difficult, and current induction techniques should probably be restricted to purely declarative logic languages.",

After formally defining the theory revision task and bounding its sample complexity, this paper addresses the task's computational complexity. It first proves that, unless P = N P , no polynomial time algorithm can identify the optimal theory, even given the exact distribution of queries, except in the most trivial of situations. It also shows that, except in such trivial situations, no polynomial-time algorithm can produce a theory whose inaccuracy is even close (i.e., within a particular polynomial factor) to optimal.

The evolutionary process leaves tell-tale signs in the DNA which can be used to construct phylogenies, or evolutionary trees, for a set of species. Maximum Likelihood Estimations (MLE) methods seek the evolutionary tree which is most likely to have produced the DNA under consideration. While these methods are widely accepted and intellectually satisfying, they have been computationally intractable. In this paper, we address the intractability of MLE methods as follows. We introduce a metric on stochastic process models of evolution. We show that this metric is meaningful by proving that in order for any algorithm to distinguish between two stochatic models that are close according to this metric, it needs to be given a lot of observations. We complement this result with a simple and efficient algorithm for inverting the stochastic process of evolution, that is, for building the tree from observations on the DNA of the species. Our result can be viewed as a result on the PAC-learnability of the class of distributions produced by tree-like processes. Though there have been many heuristics suggested for this problem, our algorithm is the first one with a guaranteed convergence rate, and further, this rate is within a polynomial of the lower-bound rate we establish. Ours is also the the first polynomial-time algorithm which is guaranteed to converge at all to the correct tree. ",

Dynamic Subset Selection (DSS) and Limited Error Fitness (LEF) are two different, adaptive variations of the standard supervised learning method used in GP. This paper compares the performance of GP, GP+DSS, and GP+LEF, on a 958 case classification problem, using a small population size of 50. A similar comparison between GP and GP+DSS is done on a larger and messier 3772 case classification problem. For both problems, GP+DSS with the small population size consistently produces a better answer using fewer tree evaluations than other runs using much larger populations. Even standard GP can be seen to perform well with the much smaller population size, indicating that it is certainly worth an exploratory run or three with a small population size before assuming that a large population size is necessary. It is an interesting notion that smaller can mean faster and better. ",

The system also runs into difficulty when more than one unit is (or should be) active at the same time. The second system is a hierarchy of transition values. This hierarchy dynamically modifies the values that specify the degree to which one unit should follow another. These values are continuous, allowing the use of gradient descent during learning.

Unfortunately, optimum scheduling is com-putationally intractable, and one must resort to carefully crafted heuristics in practice. If the scope of application of a scheduling heuristic is limited to basic blocks, considerable performance loss may be incurred at block boundaries. To overcome this obstacle, basic blocks can be coalesced across branches to form larger regions such as super blocks. In the literature, these regions are typically scheduled using algorithms that are either oblivious to profile information (under the assumption that the process of forming the region has fully utilized the profile information), or use the profile information as an addendum to classical scheduling techniques. We believe that even for the simple case of linear code regions such as super blocks, additional performance improvement can be gained by utilizing the profile information in scheduling as well. We propose a general paradigm for converting any profile-insensitive list sched-uler to a profile-sensitive scheduler. Our technique is developed via a theoretical analysis of a simplified abstract model of the general problem of profile-driven scheduling over any acyclic code region, yielding a scoring measure for ranking branch instructions. The ranking digests the profile information and has the useful property that scheduling with respect to rank is provably good for minimizing the expected completion time of the region, within the limits of the abstraction. While the ranking scheme is computation-ally intractable in the most general case, it is practicable for super blocks and suggests the heuristic that we present in this paper for profile-driven scheduling of super blocks. Experiments show that our heuristic offers substantial performance improvement over prior methods on a range of integer benchmarks and several machine models. ",

This class includes EM, penalized EM, Green's OSL-EM, and other approximate EM algorithms. The convergence analysis can be extended to include alternating coordinate-maximization EM algorithms such as Meng and Rubin's ECM and Fessler and Hero's SAGE. The condition for monotone convergence can be used to establish norms under which the distance between successive iterates and the limit point of the EM-type algorithm approaches zero monotonically. For illustration, we apply our results to estimation of Poisson rate parameters in emission tomography and establish that in the final iterations the logarithm of the EM iterates converge monotonically in a weighted Euclidean norm.

Accordingly, there have been many varieties of GA test problems with a structure based on building-blocks. Many of these problems use deceptive fitness functions to model interdependency between the bits within a block. However, very few have any model of interdependency between building-blocks; those that do are not consistent in the type of interaction used intra-block and inter-block. This paper discusses the inadequacies of the various test problems in the literature and clarifies the concept of building-block interdependency. We formulate a principled model of hierarchical interdependency that can be applied through many levels in a consistent manner and introduce Hierarchical If-and-only-if (H-IFF) as a canonical example. We present some empirical results of GAs on H-IFF showing that if population diversity is maintained and linkage is tight then the GA is able to identify and manipulate building-blocks over many levels of assembly, as the Building-Block Hypothesis suggests.

However, recurrent networks are also widely used in learning applications, in particular when time is a relevant parameter. This paper provides lower and upper bounds for the VC dimension of such networks. Several types of activation functions are discussed, including threshold, polynomial, piecewise-polynomial and sigmoidal functions. The bounds depend on two independent parameters: the number w of weights in the network, and the length k of the input sequence. In contrast, for feedforward networks, VC dimension bounds can be expressed as a function of w only. An important difference between recurrent and feedforward nets is that a fixed recurrent net can receive inputs of arbitrary length. Therefore we are particularly interested in the case k w. Ignoring multiplicative constants, the main results say roughly the following: * For architectures with activation = any fixed nonlinear polynomial, the VC dimension is wk. * For architectures with activation = any fixed piecewise polynomial, the VC dimension is between wk and w 2 k. * For architectures with activation = H (threshold nets), the VC dimension is between w log(k=w) and minfwk log wk; w 2 + w log wkg. * For the standard sigmoid (x) = 1=(1 + e x ), the VC dimension is between wk and w 4 k 2 .

The problems of identifying and reconsidering the subplans affected by changed circumstances or goals are closely related to the problems of revising beliefs as new or changed information is gained. But traditional techniques of reason maintenance|the standard method for belief revision|choose revisions arbitrarily and enforce global notions of consistency and groundedness which may mean reconsidering all beliefs or plan elements at each step. To address these problems, we developed (1) revision methods aimed at revising only those beliefs and plans worth revising, and tolerating incoherence and ungroundedness when these are judged less detrimental than a costly revision effort, (2) an artificial market economy in planning and revision tasks for arriving at overall judgments of worth, and (3) a representation for qualitative preferences that permits capture of common forms of dominance information. We view the activities of intelligent agents as stemming from interleaved or simultaneous planning, replanning, execution, and observation subactivities. In this model of the plan construction process, the agents continually evaluate and revise their plans in light of what happens in the world. Planning is necessary for the organization of large-scale activities because decisions about actions to be taken in the future have direct impact on what should be done in the shorter term. But even if well-constructed, the value of a plan decays as changing circumstances, resources, information, or objectives render the original course of action inappropriate. When changes occur before or during execution of the plan, it may be necessary to construct a new plan by starting from scratch or by revising a previous plan. only the portions of the plan actually affected by the changes. Given the information accrued during plan execution, which remaining parts of the original plan should be salvaged and in what ways should other parts be changed? Incremental replanning first involves localizing the potential changes or conflicts by identifying the subset of the extant beliefs and plans in which they occur. It then involves choosing which of the identified beliefs and plans to keep and which to change. For greatest efficiency, the choices of what portion of the plan to revise and how to revise it should be based on coherent expectations about and preferences among the consequences of different alternatives so as to be rational in the sense of decision theory (Savage 1972). Our work toward mechanizing rational planning and replanning has focussed on four main issues: This paper focusses on the latter three issues; for our approach to the first, see (Doyle 1988; 1992). Replanning in an incremental and local manner requires that the planning procedures routinely identify the assumptions made during planning and connect plan elements with these assumptions, so that replan-ning may seek to change only those portions of a plan dependent upon assumptions brought into question by new information. Consequently, the problem of revising plans to account for changed conditions has much ",

    "text": "Title: Theory of Correlations in Stochastic Neural Networks  \nAbstract: One of the main experimental tools in probing the interactions between neurons has been the measurement of the correlations in their activity. In general, however the interpretation of the observed correlations is difficult, since the correlation between a pair of neurons is influenced not only by the direct interaction between them but also by the dynamic state of the entire network to which they belong. Thus, a comparison between the observed correlations and the predictions from specific model networks is needed. In this paper we develop the theory of neuronal correlation functions in large networks comprising of several highly connected subpopulations, and obeying stochastic dynamic rules. When the networks are in asynchronous states, the cross-correlations are relatively weak, i.e., their amplitude relative to that of the auto-correlations is of order of 1=N , N being the size of the interacting populations. Using the weakness of the cross-correlations, general equations which express the matrix of cross-correlations in terms of the mean neuronal activities, and the effective interaction matrix are presented. The effective interactions are the synaptic efficacies multiplied by the the gain of the postsynaptic neurons. The time-delayed cross-correlation matrix can be expressed as a sum of exponentially decaying modes that correspond to the (non-orthogonal) eigenvectors of the effective interaction matrix. The theory is extended to networks with random connectivity, such as randomly dilute networks. This allows for the comparison between the contribution from the internal common input and that from the direct ",

    "text": "Title: Stochastic Logic Programs  \nAbstract: One way to represent a machine learning algorithm's bias over the hypothesis and instance space is as a pair of probability distributions. This approach has been taken both within Bayesian learning schemes and the framework of U-learnability. However, it is not obvious how an Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) system should best be provided with a probability distribution. This paper extends the results of a previous paper by the author which introduced stochastic logic programs as a means of providing a structured definition of such a probability distribution. Stochastic logic programs are a generalisation of stochastic grammars. A stochastic logic program consists of a set of labelled clauses p : C where p is from the interval [0; 1] and C is a range-restricted definite clause. A stochastic logic program P has a distributional semantics, that is one which assigns a probability distribution to the atoms of each predicate in the Herbrand base of the clauses in P . These probabilities are assigned to atoms according to an SLD-resolution strategy which employs a stochastic selection rule. It is shown that the probabilities can be computed directly for fail-free logic programs and by normalisation for arbitrary logic programs. The stochastic proof strategy can be used to provide three distinct functions: 1) a method of sampling from the Herbrand base which can be used to provide selected targets or example sets for ILP experiments, 2) a measure of the information content of examples or hypotheses; this can be used to guide the search in an ILP system and 3) a simple method for conditioning a given stochastic logic program on samples of data. Functions 1) and 3) are used to measure the generality of hypotheses in the ILP system Progol4.2. This supports an implementation of a Bayesian technique for learning from positive examples only. fl This paper is an extension of a paper with the same title which appeared in [12] ",

In ICL, examples are viewed as interpretations which are true or false for the target theory, whereas in present inductive logic programming systems, examples are true and false ground facts (or clauses). Furthermore, ICL uses a clausal representation, which corresponds to a conjunctive normal form where each conjunct forms a constraint on positive examples, whereas classical learning techniques have concentrated on concept representations in disjunctive normal form. We present some experiments with this new system on the mutagenesis problem. These experiments illustrate some of the differences with other systems, and indicate that our approach should work at least as well as the more classical approaches.",

Automated Synthesis of Analog Electrical Circuits by Means of Genetic Programming  \nAbstract: The design (synthesis) of analog electrical circuits starts with a high-level statement of the circuit's desired behavior and requires creating a circuit that satisfies the specified design goals. Analog circuit synthesis entails the creation of both the topology and the sizing (numerical values) of all of the circuit's components. The difficulty of the problem of analog circuit synthesis is well known and there is no previously known general automated technique for synthesizing an analog circuit from a high-level statement of the circuit's desired behavior. This paper presents a single uniform approach using genetic programming for the automatic synthesis of both the topology and sizing of a suite of eight different prototypical analog circuits, including a lowpass filter, a crossover (woofer and tweeter) filter, a source identification circuit, an amplifier, a computational circuit, a time-optimal controller circuit, a temperaturesensing circuit, and a voltage reference circuit. The problemspecific information required for each of the eight problems is minimal and consists primarily of the number of inputs and outputs of the desired circuit, the types of available components, and a fitness measure that restates the high-level statement of the circuit's desired behavior as a measurable mathematical quantity. The eight genetically evolved circuits constitute an instance of an evolutionary computation technique producing results on a task that is usually thought of as requiring human intelligence. The fact that a single uniform approach yielded a satisfactory design for each of the eight circuits as well as the fact that a satisfactory design was created on the first or second run of each problem are evidence for the general applicability of genetic programming for solving the problem of automatic synthesis of analog electrical circuits.

While nonlinear variants of PCA have been proposed, an alternative paradigm is to capture data complexity by a combination of local linear PCA projections. However, conventional PCA does not correspond to a probability density, and so there is no unique way to combine PCA models. Previous attempts to formulate mixture models for PCA have therefore to some extent been ad hoc. In this paper, PCA is formulated within a maximum-likelihood framework, based on a specific form of Gaussian latent variable model. This leads to a well-defined mixture model for probabilistic principal component analysers, whose parameters can be determined using an EM algorithm. We discuss the advantages of this model in the context of clustering, density modelling and local dimensionality reduction, and we demonstrate its application to image compression and handwritten digit recognition.

The design process starts with the random creation of a large population of program trees composed of circuit-constructing functions. Each program tree specifies the steps by which a fully developed circuit is to be progressively developed from a common embryonic circuit appropriate for the type of circuit that the user wishes to design. Each fully developed circuit is translated into a netlist, simulated using a modified version of SPICE, and evaluated as to how well it satisfies the user's design requirements. The fitness measure is a user-written computer program that may incorporate any calculable characteristic or combination of characteristics of the circuit, including the circuit's behavior in the time domain, its behavior in the frequency domain, its power consumption, the number of components, cost of components, or surface area occupied by its components. The population of program trees is genetically bred over a series of many generations using genetic programming. Genetic programming is driven by a fitness measure and employs genetic operations such as Darwinian reproduction, sexual recombination (crossover), and occasional mutation to create offspring. This automated evolutionary process produces both the topology of the circuit and the numerical values for each component. This paper describes how genetic programming can evolve the circuit for a difficult-to-design low-pass filter. ",

These algorithms differ in terms of the topology of the networks that they construct which in turn biases the search for a decision boundary that correctly classifies the training set. This paper presents an analysis of such algorithms from a geometrical perspective. This analysis helps in a better characterization of the search bias employed by the different algorithms in relation to the geometrical distribution of examples in the training set. Simple experiments with non linearly separable training sets support the results of mathematical analysis of such algorithms. This suggests the possibility of designing more efficient constructive algorithms that dynamically choose among different biases to build near-minimal networks for pattern classification. ",

We present theory and algorithms for intermixing TD models of the world at different levels of temporal abstraction within a single structure. Such multi-scale TD models can be used in model-based reinforcement-learning architectures and dynamic programming methods in place of conventional Markov models. This enables planning at higher and varied levels of abstraction, and, as such, may prove useful in formulating methods for hierarchical or multi-level planning and reinforcement learning. In this paper we treat only the prediction problem|that of learning a model and value function for the case of fixed agent behavior.

Both are variants of modulo scheduling, a framework for generation of software pipelines pioneered by Rau and Glaser [RaGl81], but are otherwise quite dissimilar. One technique was developed at Silicon Graphics and is used in the MIPSpro compiler. This is the production compiler for SGI s systems which are based on the MIPS R8000 processor [Hsu94]. It is essentially a branchandbound enumeration of possible schedules with extensive pruning. This method is heuristic because of the way it prunes and also because of the interaction between register allocation and scheduling. 1 The second technique aims to produce optimal results by formulating the scheduling and register allocation problem as an integrated integer linear programming (ILP 1 ) problem. This idea has received much recent exposure in the literature [AlGoGa95, Feautrier94, GoAlGa94a, GoAlGa94b, Eichenberger95], but to our knowledge all previous implementations have been too preliminary for detailed measurement and evaluation. In particular, we believe this to be the first published measurement of runtime performance for ILP based generation of software pipelines. A particularly valuable result of this study was evaluation of the heuristic pipelining technology in the SGI compiler . One of the motivations behind the McGill research was the hope that optimal software pipelining, while not in itself practical for use in production compilers, would be useful for their evaluation and validation. Our comparison has indeed provided a quantitative validation of the SGI compilers pipeliner, leading us to increased confidence in both techniques. ",

This step is then followed by a projection of the current iterate onto the separating hyperplane. All information required for this projection operation is readily available at the end of the approximate proximal step, and therefore this projection entails no additional computational cost. The new algorithm allows significant relaxation of tolerance requirements imposed on the solution of proximal point subproblems, which yields a more practical framework. Weak global convergence and local linear rate of convergence are established under suitable assumptions. Additionally, presented analysis yields an alternative proof of convergence for the exact proximal point method, which allows a nice geometric interpretation, and is somewhat more intuitive than the classical proof.

The double dissociation between prosopagnosia, a face recognition deficit occurring after brain damage, and visual object agnosia, difficulty recognizing other kinds of complex objects, indicates that face and non-face object recognition may be served by partially independent mechanisms in the brain. Is neural specialization innate or learned? We suggest that this specialization could be the result of a competitive learning mechanism that, during development, devotes neural resources to the tasks they are best at performing. Further, we suggest that the specialization arises as an interaction between task requirements and developmental constraints. In this paper, we present a feed-forward computational model of visual processing, in which two modules compete to classify input stimuli. When one module receives low spatial frequency information and the other receives high spatial frequency information, and the task is to identify the faces while simply classifying the objects, the low frequency network shows a strong specialization for faces. No other combination of tasks and inputs shows this strong specialization. We take these results as support for the idea that an innately-specified face processing module is unnecessary.",

Boosting is a general method of combining multiple classifiers due to Yoav Freund and Rob Schapire. This paper shows that boosting applied to naive Bayesian classifiers yields combination classifiers that are representationally equivalent to standard feedforward multilayer perceptrons. (An ancillary result is that naive Bayesian classification is a nonparametric, nonlinear generalization of logistic regression.) As a training algorithm, boosted naive Bayesian learning is quite different from backpropagation, and has definite advantages. Boosting requires only linear time and constant space, and hidden nodes are learned incrementally, starting with the most important. On the real-world datasets on which the method has been tried so far, generalization performance is as good as or better than the best published result using any other learning method. Unlike all other standard learning algorithms, naive Bayesian learning, with and without boosting, can be done in logarithmic time with a linear number of parallel computing units. Accordingly, these learning methods are highly plausible computationally as models of animal learning. Other arguments suggest that they are plausible behaviorally also. ",

We have used this work to develop a computational model that has been partially implemented in an explanation facility for an existing tutoring system known as SHERLOCK. We are implementing a system that uses case-based reasoning to identify previous situations and explanations that could potentially affect the explanation being constructed. We have identified heuristics for constructing explanations that exploit this information in ways similar to what we have observed in When human tutors engage in dialogue, they freely exploit all aspects of the mutually known context, including the previous discourse. Utterances that do not draw on previous discourse seem awkward, unnatural, or even incoherent. Previous discourse must be taken into account in order to relate new information effectively to recently conveyed material, and to avoid repeating old material that would distract the student from what is new. Thus, strategies for using the dialogue history in generating explanations are of great importance to research in natural language generation for tutorial applications. The goal of our work is to produce a computational model of the effects of discourse context on explanations in instructional dialogues, and to implement this model in an intelligent tutoring system that maintains a dialogue history and uses it in planning its explanations. Based on a study of human-human instructional dialogues, we have developed a taxonomy that classifies the types of contextual effects that occur in our data according to the explanatory functions they serve (16). In this paper, we focus on one important category from our taxonomy: situations in which the tutor explicitly refers to a previous explanation in order to point out similarities (differences) between the material currently being explained and material presented in earlier explanation(s). We are implementing a system that uses case-based reasoning to identify previous situations and explanations that could potentially affect the explanation being constructed. We have identified heuristics for constructing explanations that exploit this information in ways similar to what we have observed in instructional dialogues produced by human tutors. By building a computer system that has this capability as an optional facility that can be enabled or disabled, we will be able to systematically evaluate our hypothesis that this is a useful tutoring strategy. In order to test our hypotheses about the effects of previous discourse on explanations, we are building an explanation component for an existing intelligent training system, Sherlock (11). Sherlock is an intelligent coached practice environment for training avionics technicians to troubleshoot complex electronic equipment. Using Sherlock, trainees solve problems with minimal tutor interaction and then review their troubleshooting behavior in a post-problem reflective follow-up session (rfu) where the tutor instructional dialogues produced by human tutors.",

Our algorithm uses exact matches of short patterns randomly selected from fragment data to identify fragment overlaps, construct an overlap map, and finally deliver a consensus sequence. We show how statistical clues made explicit in our approach can easily be exploited to correctly assemble results even in the presence of extensive repetitive sequences. Our approach is exceptionally fast in practice: e.g., we have successfully assembled a whole Mycoplasma genitalium genome (approximately 580 kbps) in roughly 8 minutes of 64MB 200MHz Pentium Pro CPU time from real shotgun data, where most existing algorithms can be expected to run for several hours to a day on the same data. Moreover, experiments with shotgun data synthetically prepared from real DNA sequences from a wide range of organisms (including human DNA) and containing extensive repeating regions demonstrate our algorithm's robustness to noise and the presence of repetitive sequences.

In our logic, the fact that the agent's set of beliefs is is represented by the sentence O, where O is Levesque's `only know' operator. Intuitively, O is read as ` is all that is believed.' The fact that the agent believes is represented by the sentence B , read in the usual way as ` is believed'. The connective represents update as defined by Katsuno and Mendelzon.

We show that for every revision operator that satisfies the AGM postulates, there is a model for our epistemic logic such that the beliefs implied by the sentence O B in this model correspond exactly to the sentences implied by the theory that results from revising by . This means that reasoning about changes in the agent's beliefs reduces to model checking of certain epistemic sentences. The negative result in the paper is that this type of formal account of revision cannot be extended to the situation where the agent is able to reason about its beliefs. A fully introspective agent cannot use our construction to reason about the results of its own revisions, on pain of triviality. ",

The synapses develop under dynamics determined by a matrix that is closely related to the covariance matrix of input cell activities. We analyse the dynamics of the learning rule in terms of the eigenvectors of this matrix. These eigenvectors represent independently evolving weight structures. Some general theorems are presented regarding the properties of these eigenvectors and their eigenvalues. For a general covariance matrix four principal parameter regimes are predicted. We concentrate on the gaussian covariances at layer B ! C of Linsker's network. Analytic and numerical solutions for the eigenvectors at this layer are presented. Three eigenvectors dominate the dynamics: a DC eigenvector, in which all synapses have the same sign; a bi-lobed, oriented eigenvector; and a circularly symmetric, centre-surround eigenvector. Analysis of the circumstances in which each of these vectors dominates yields an explanation of the emergence of centre-surround structures and symmetry-breaking bi-lobed structures. Criteria are developed estimating the boundary of the parameter regime in which centre-surround structures emerge. The application of our analysis to Linsker's higher layers, at which the covariance functions were oscillatory, is briefly discussed. ",

When the proposal variance is appropriately scaled according to n, the sequence of stochastic processes formed by the first component of each Markov chain, converge to the appropriate limiting Langevin diffusion process. The limiting diffusion approximation admits a straight-forward efficiency maximization problem, and the resulting asymptotically optimal policy is related to the asymptotic acceptance rate of proposed moves for the algorithm. The asymptotically optimal acceptance rate is 0.234 under quite general conditions. The main result is proved in the case where the target density has a symmetric product form.

Neural networks can address the tuning problem, but are less useful for decomposition and coordination. We hypothesize that interacting reactions can be decomposed into separate behaviors resident in separate networks and that the interaction can be coordinated through the tuning mechanism and a higher level controller. To explore these issues, we have implemented a neural network architecture as the reactive component of a two layer control system for a simulated race car. By varying the architecture, we test whether decomposing reactivity into separate behaviors leads to superior overall performance, coordination and learning convergence. ",

For example, in many robotic domains, the problem solver is required to monitor real-valued perceptual inputs and vary its motor control parameters in a continuous, on-line manner to successfully accomplish its task. In such domains, discrete symbolic states and operators are difficult to define. To improve its performance in continuous problem domains, a problem solver must learn, modify, and use continuous operators that continuously map input sensory information to appropriate control outputs. Additionally, the problem solver must learn the contexts in which those continuous operators are applicable. We propose a learning method that can compile sensorimo-tor experiences into continuous operators, which can then be used to improve performance of the problem solver. The method speeds up the task performance as well as results in improvements in the quality of the resulting solutions.

The consensus sequence information is summarized in conditional probability matrices which, when used to locate signals in uncharacter-ized genomic DNA, have greater sensitivity and specificity than conventional matrices. Species-specific versions of these matrices are especially effective at distinguishing true and false sites. ",

The networks perform well on sentences containing a single main predicate (encoded by transitive verbs or prepositions) applied to multiple-feature objects (encoded as noun-phrases with adjectival modifiers), and shows robustness against ungrammatical inputs. A second set of experiments deals with sentences containing embedded structures. Here the network is able to process multiple levels of sentence-final embeddings but only one level of center-embedding. This turns out to be a consequence of the network's inability to retain information that is not reflected in the outputs over intermediate phases of processing. Two extensions to Elman's [9] original recurrent network architecture are introduced. ",

A single (unknown) probability distribution over the domain is used to generate random examples for the learning algorithm and measure the speed at which the target changes. Clearly, the more rapidly the target moves, the harder it is for the algorithm to maintain a good approximation of the target. Therefore we evaluate algorithms based on how much movement of the target can be tolerated between examples while predicting with accuracy *. Furthermore, the complexity of the class H of possible targets, as measured by d, its VC-dimension, also effects the difficulty of tracking the target concept. We show that if the problem of minimizing the number of disagreements with a sample from among concepts in a class H can be approximated to within a factor k, then there is a simple tracking algorithm for H which can achieve a probability * of making a mistake if the target movement rate is at most a constant times * 2 =(k(d + k) ln 1 * ), where d is the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension of H. Also, we show that if H is properly PAC-learnable, then there is an efficient (randomized) algorithm that with high probability approximately minimizes disagreements to within a factor of 7d + 1, yielding an efficient tracking algorithm for H which tolerates drift rates up to a constant times * 2 =(d 2 ln 1 In addition, we prove complementary results for the classes of halfspaces and axis-aligned hy- perrectangles showing that the maximum rate of drift that any algorithm (even with unlimited computational power) can tolerate is a constant times * 2 =d.

An opinion pool derives a single consensus distribution over the events, representative of the group as a whole. Several pooling functions have been proposed, each sensible under particular assumptions or measures. Many researchers over many years have failed to form a consensus on which method is best. We propose a market-based pooling procedure, and analyze its properties. Participants bet on securities, each paying off contingent on an uncertain event, so as to maximize their own expected utilities. The consensus probability of each event is defined as the corresponding security's equilibrium price. The market framework provides explicit monetary incentives for participation and honesty, and allows agents to maintain individual rationality and limited privacy. \"No arbitrage\" arguments ensure that the equilibrium prices form legal probabilities. We show that, when events are disjoint and all participants have exponential utility for money, the market derives the same result as the logarithmic opinion pool; similarly, logarithmic utility for money yields the linear opinion pool. In both cases, we prove that the group's behavior is, to an outside observer, indistinguishable from that of a rational individual, whose beliefs equal the equilibrium prices. ",

We show that this can happen even when the population retains a high level of variety and show that in many cases evolution from the sub-optimal solution to the solution is possible if sufficient time is allowed. In both cases theoretical models are presented and compared with actual runs. Experimental evidence is presented that Price's Covariance and Selection Theorem can be applied to GP populations and the practical effect of program size restrictions are noted.

Modern benchmarks generate extremely long traces, resulting in problems with data storage, as well as very long simulation run times. More fundamentally, simulation generally does not provide significant insight into the factors that determine performance or a characterization of their interactions. This paper proposes a theoretical model of superscalar processor performance that addresses these shortcomings. Performance is viewed as an interaction of program parallelism and machine parallelism. Both program and machine parallelisms are decomposed into multiple component functions. Methods for measuring or computing these functions are described. The functions are combined to provide a model of the interaction between program and machine parallelisms and an accurate estimate of the performance. The computed performance, based on this model, is compared to simulated performance for six benchmarks from the SPEC 92 suite on several configurations of the IBM RS/6000 instruction set architecture.

A joint prediction scheme where prediction of transition regions between introns and exons regulates a cutoff level for splice site assignment was able to predict splice site locations with confidence levels far better than previously reported in the literature. The problem of predicting donor and acceptor sites in human genes is hampered by the presence of numerous amounts of false positives | in the paper the distribution of these false splice sites is examined and linked to a possible scenario for the splicing mechanism in vivo. When the presented method detects 95% of the true donor and acceptor sites it makes less than 0.1% false donor site assignments and less than 0.4% false acceptor site assignments. For the large data set used in this study this means that on the average there are one and a half false donor sites per true donor site and six false acceptor sites per true acceptor site. With the joint assignment method more than a fifth of the true donor sites and around one fourth of the true acceptor sites could be detected without accompaniment of any false positive predictions. Highly confident splice sites could not be isolated with a widely used weight matrix method or by separate splice site networks. A complementary relation between the confidence levels of the coding/non-coding and the separate splice site networks was observed, with many weak splice sites having sharp transitions in the coding/non-coding signal and many stronger splice sites having more ill-defined transitions between coding and non-coding.

Part I: Foundations  \nAbstract: Belief change is a fundamental problem in AI: Agents constantly have to update their beliefs to accommodate new observations. In recent years, there has been much work on axiomatic characterizations of belief change. We claim that a better understanding of belief change can be gained from examining appropriate semantic models. In this paper we propose a general framework in which to model belief change. We begin by defining belief in terms of knowledge and plausibility: an agent believes if he knows that is more plausible than :. We then consider some properties defining the interaction between knowledge and plausibility, and show how these properties affect the properties of belief. In particular, we show that by assuming two of the most natural properties, belief becomes a KD45 operator. Finally, we add time to the picture. This gives us a framework in which we can talk about knowledge, plausibility (and hence belief), and time, which extends the framework of Halpern and Fagin for modeling knowledge in multi-agent systems. We then examine the problem of \"minimal change\". This notion can be captured by using prior plausibilities, an analogue to prior probabilities, which can be updated by \"conditioning\". We show by example that conditioning on a plausibility measure can capture many scenarios of interest. In a companion paper, we show how the two best-studied scenarios of belief change, belief revision and belief update, fit into our framework. ?

    "text": "Title: A Hierarchical Latent Variable Model for Data Visualization  \nAbstract: Visualization has proven to be a powerful and widely-applicable tool for the analysis and interpretation of multi-variate data. Most visualization algorithms aim to find a projection from the data space down to a two-dimensional visualization space. However, for complex data sets living in a high-dimensional space it is unlikely that a single two-dimensional projection can reveal all of the interesting structure. We therefore introduce a hierarchical visualization algorithm which allows the complete data set to be visualized at the top level, with clusters and sub-clusters of data points visualized at deeper levels. The algorithm is based on a hierarchical mixture of latent variable models, whose parameters are estimated using the expectation-maximization algorithm. We demonstrate the principle of the approach on a toy data set, and we then apply the algorithm to the visualization of a synthetic data set in 12 dimensions obtained from a simulation of multi-phase flows in oil pipelines, and to data in 36 dimensions derived from satellite images. A Matlab software implementation of the algorithm is publicly available from the world-wide web. ",

If the resulting vector yields a lower objective function value than a predetermined population member, the newly generated vector replaces the vector, with which it was compared, in the next generation; otherwise, the old vector is retained. This basic principle, however, is extended when it comes to the practical variants of DE. For example an existing vector can be perturbed by adding more than one weighted difference vector to it. In most cases, it is also worthwhile to mix the parameters of the old vector with those of the perturbed one before comparing the objective function values.

Diterpenes are organic compounds of low molecular weight that are based on a skeleton of 20 carbon atoms. They are of significant chemical and commercial interest because of their use as lead compounds in the search for new pharmaceutical effectors. The structure elucidation of diterpenes based on 13 C NMR spectra is usually done manually by human experts with specialized background knowledge on peak patterns and chemical structures. In the process, each of the 20 skeletal atoms is assigned an atom number that corresponds to its proper place in the skeleton and the diterpene is classified into one of the possible skeleton types. We address the problem of learning classification rules from a database of peak patterns for diterpenes with known structure. Recently, propositional learning was successfully applied to learn classification rules from spectra with assigned atom numbers. As the assignment of atom numbers is a difficult process in itself (and possibly indistinguishable from the classification process), we apply ILP, i.e., relational learning, to the problem of classifying spectra without assigned atom numbers.

In using genetic programming to produce such teams, one faces several design decisions. First, there are questions of team diversity and of breeding strategy. In one commonly used scheme, teams consist of clones of single individuals; these individuals breed in the normal way and are cloned to form teams during fitness evaluation. In contrast, teams could also consist of distinct individuals. In this case one can either allow free interbreeding between members of different teams, or one can restrict interbreeding in various ways. A second design decision concerns the types of coordination-facilitating mechanisms provided to individual team members; these range from sensors of various sorts to complex communication systems. This paper examines three breeding strategies (clones, free, and restricted) and three coordination mechanisms (none, deictic sensing, and name-based sensing) for evolving teams of agents in the Serengeti world, a simple predator/prey environment. Among the conclusions are the fact that a simple form of restricted interbreeding outperforms free interbreeding in all teams with distinct individuals, and the fact that name-based sensing consistently outperforms deictic sensing.",

In this paper we summarize an approach to this problem based on the mathematical framework of Markov decision processes and reinforcement learning. Current model-based reinforcement learning is based on one-step models that cannot represent common-sense higher-level actions, such as going to lunch, grasping an object, or flying to Denver. This paper generalizes prior work on temporally abstract models [Sutton, 1995] and extends it from the prediction setting to include actions, control, and planning. We introduce a more general form of temporally abstract model, the multi-time model, and establish its suitability for planning and learning by virtue of its relationship to the Bellman equations. This paper summarizes the theoretical framework of multi-time models and illustrates their potential advantages in a The need for hierarchical and abstract planning is a fundamental problem in AI (see, e.g., Sacerdoti, 1977; Laird et al., 1986; Korf, 1985; Kaelbling, 1993; Dayan & Hinton, 1993). Model-based reinforcement learning offers a possible solution to the problem of integrating planning with real-time learning and decision-making (Peng & Williams, 1993, Moore & Atkeson, 1993; Sutton and Barto, 1998). However, current model-based reinforcement learning is based on one-step models that cannot represent common-sense, higher-level actions. Modeling such actions requires the ability to handle different, interrelated levels of temporal abstraction. A new approach to modeling at multiple time scales was introduced by Sutton (1995) based on prior work by Singh , Dayan , and Sutton and Pinette . This approach enables models of the environment at different temporal scales to be intermixed, producing temporally abstract models. However, that work was concerned only with predicting the environment. This paper summarizes an extension of the approach including actions and control of the environment [Precup & Sutton, 1997]. In particular, we generalize the usual notion of a gridworld planning task.",

Two such algorithms are defined, and expressions for their classification accuracy are derived as a function of the size of training sample. A series of experiments using artificial and `natural' data sets is described in which the learning curve for a case-based learner is compared with those for the apparently trivial rote-learning learning algorithms. The results show that in a number of `plausible' situations, the learning curves for a simple case-based learner and the `majority' rote-learner can barely be distinguished, although a domain is demonstrated where favourable performance from the case-based learner is observed. This suggests that the maxim of case-based reasoning that `similar problems have similar solutions' may be useful as the basis of a generalisation strategy only in selected domains.",

A rich and complex body of work has evolved, with nearly- or exactly- minimax estimators being obtained for a variety of interesting problems. Unfortunately, the results have often not been translated into practice, for a variety of reasons sometimes, similarity to known methods, sometimes, computational intractability, and sometimes, lack of spatial adaptivity. We discuss a method for curve estimation based on n noisy data; one translates the empirical wavelet coefficients towards the origin by an amount method is different from methods in common use today, is computationally practical, and is spatially adaptive; thus it avoids a number of previous objections to minimax estimators. At the same time, the method is nearly minimax for a wide variety of loss functions - e.g. pointwise error, global error measured in L p norms, pointwise and global error in estimation of derivatives and for a wide range of smoothness classes, including standard Holder classes, Sobolev classes, and Bounded Variation. This is a much broader near-optimality than anything previously proposed in the minimax literature. Finally, the theory underlying the method is interesting, as it exploits a correspondence between statistical questions and questions of optimal recovery and information-based complexity.

While standard diagnosis involves purely probabilistic inference in fully specified networks, causal analysis involves partially specified networks in which the links are given causal interpretation and where the domain of some variables are unknown. The system presented in this paper provides the clinical research community, we believe for the first time, an assumption-free, unbiased assessment of the average treatment effect.

    "text": "Title: Speculative Hedge: Regulating Compile-Time Speculation Against Profile Variations code performance in the presence of execution\nAbstract: Path-oriented scheduling methods, such as trace scheduling and hyperblock scheduling, use speculation to extract instruction-level parallelism from control-intensive programs. These methods predict important execution paths in the current scheduling scope using execution profiling or frequency estimation. Aggressive speculation is then applied to the important execution paths, possibly at the cost of degraded performance along other paths. Therefore, the speed of the output code can be sensitive to the compiler's ability to accurately predict the important execution paths. Prior work in this area has utilized the speculative yield function by Fisher, coupled with dependence height, to distribute instruction priority among execution paths in the scheduling scope. While this technique provides more stability of performance by paying attention to the needs of all paths, it does not directly address the problem of mismatch between compile-time prediction and run-time behavior. The work presented in this paper extends the speculative yield and dependence height heuristic to explicitly minimize the penalty suffered by other paths when instructions are speculated along a path. Since the execution time of a path is determined by the number of cycles spent between a path's entrance and exit in the scheduling scope, the heuristic attempts to eliminate unnecessary speculation that delays any path's exit. Such control of speculation makes the performance much less sensitive to the actual path taken at run time. The proposed method has a strong emphasis on achieving minimal delay to all exits. Thus the name, speculative hedge, is used. This paper presents the speculative hedge heuristic, and shows how it controls over-speculation in a superblock/hyperblock scheduler.

In a manner similar to early GA research, we use interpretations of our GP Schema Theorem to obtain a GP Building Block definition and to state a \"classical\" Building Block Hypothesis (BBH): that GP searches by hierarchically combining building blocks. We report that this approach is not convincing for several reasons: it is difficult to find support for the promotion and combination of building blocks solely by rigourous interpretation of a GP Schema Theorem; even if there were such support for a BBH, it is empirically questionable whether building blocks always exist because partial solutions of consistently above average fitness and resilience to disruption are not assured; also, a BBH constitutes a narrow and imprecise account of GP search behavior.",

Yet, despite increased theoretical understanding, RL algorithms remain applicable to simple tasks only. In this paper I use the abstract framework afforded by the connection to dynamic programming to discuss the scaling issues faced by RL researchers. I focus on learning agents that have to learn to solve multiple structured RL tasks in the same environment. I propose learning abstract environment models where the abstract actions represent \"intentions\" of achieving a particular state. Such models are variable temporal resolution models because in different parts of the state space the abstract actions span different number of time steps. The operational definitions of abstract actions can be learned incrementally using repeated experience at solving RL tasks. I prove that under certain conditions solutions to new RL tasks can be found by using simu lated experience with abstract actions alone.",

Analysis of shorter solutions shows they have many of the characteristics often ascribed to manually coded programs. Enumeration of a small fraction of the total search space and random sampling characterise it as rugged with many multiple plateaus split by deep valleys and many local and global optima. This suggests it is difficult for hill climbing algorithms. Analysis of the program search space in terms of fixed length schema suggests it is highly deceptive and that for the simplest solutions large building blocks must be assembled before they have above average fitness. In some cases we show solutions cannot be assembled using a fixed representation from small building blocks of above average fitness. These suggest the Ant problem is difficult for Genetic Algorithms. Random sampling of the program search space suggests on average the density of global optima changes only slowly with program size but the density of neutral networks linking points of the same fitness grows approximately linearly with program length. This is part of the cause of bloat. ",

The key feature of our approach is the distinction between a user level and an expert level of language bias declarations. The expert provides abstract meta-declarations, and the user declares the relationship between the meta-level and the given database to obtain a low-level declarative language bias. The suggested languages allow for compact and abstract specifications of the declarative language bias for top-down ILP systems using schemata. We verified several properties of the translation algorithm that generates schemata, and applied it successfully to a few chemical domains.

To emphasize the role of the lateral inhibitory learning rules, the EXIN and the LISSOM simulations were done with only lateral inhibitory learning. During scotoma conditioning, the EXIN model without feedforward learning produces centrifugal expansion of RFs initially inside the scotoma region, accompanied by increased responsiveness, without changes in spontaneous activation. The EXIN model without feedforward learning is more consistent with the neurophysiological data than are the adaptation model and the LISSOM model.

The conditional probability distribution network can perform both direct predictions and iterated predictions, a task which is specific for time series problems. We compare our method to fuzzy logic and discuss important differences, and also demonstrate the architecture on two time series. The first is the benchmark laser series used in the Santa Fe competition, a deterministic chaotic system. The second is a time series from a Markov process which exhibits structure on two time scales. The network produces multimodal predictions for this series.

Empirical studies show that good results can be achieved with TSL [8, 11]. However, TSL has several drawbacks. Training set learners (e.g., backpropagation) are typically slow as they may require many passes over the training set. Also, there is no guarantee that, given an arbitrary training set, the system will find enough good critical features to get a reasonable approximation of A. Moreover, the number of features to be searched is exponential in the number of inputs, and TSL becomes computationally expensive [1]. Finally, the scarcity of interesting positive theoretical results suggests the difficulty of learning without sufficient a priori knowledge. The goal of learning systems is to generalize. Generalization is commonly based on the set of critical features the system has available. Training set learners typically extract critical features from a random set of examples. While this approach is attractive, it suffers from the exponential growth of the number of features to be searched. We propose to extend it by endowing the system with some a priori knowledge, in the form of precepts. Advantages of the augmented system are speedup, improved generalization, and greater parsimony. This paper presents a precept-driven learning algorithm. Its main features include: 1) distributed implementation, 2) bounded learning and execution times, and 3) ability to handle both correct and incorrect precepts. Results of simulations on real-world data demonstrate promise. This paper presents precept-driven learning (PDL). PDL is intended to overcome some of TSL's weaknesses. In PDL, the training set is augmented by a small set of precepts. A pair p = (i, o) in I O is called an example. A precept is an example in which some of the i-entries (inputs) are set to the special value don't-care. An input whose value is not don't-care is said to be asserted. If i has no effect on the value of the output. The use of the special value don't-care is therefore as a shorthand. A pair containing don't-care inputs represents as many examples as the product of the sizes of the input domains of its don't-care inputs. 1. Introduction ",

    "text": "Title: A Connectionist Architecture with Inherent Systematicity  \nAbstract: For connectionist networks to be adequate for higher level cognitive activities such as natural language interpretation, they have to generalize in a way that is appropriate given the regularities of the domain. Fodor and Pylyshyn (1988) identified an important pattern of regularities in such domains, which they called systematicity. Several attempts have been made to show that connectionist networks can generalize in accordance with these regularities, but not to the satisfaction of the critics. To address this challenge, this paper starts by establishing the implications of systematicity for connectionist solutions to the variable binding problem. Based on the work of Hadley (1994a), we argue that the network must generalize information it learns in one variable binding to other variable bindings. We then show that temporal synchrony variable binding (Shas-tri and Ajjanagadde, 1993) inherently generalizes in this way. Thereby we show that temporal synchrony variable binding is a connectionist architecture that accounts for systematicity. This is an important step in showing that connectionism can be an adequate architecture for higher level cognition. ",

However, in their basic form, they tend to have a large number of hidden nodes. One common solution to this problem is to keep only a randomly-selected subset of the original training data in building the network. This paper presents an algorithm called the Reduced Probabilistic Neural Network (RPNN) that seeks to choose a better-than-random subset of the available instances to use as center points of nodes in the network. The algorithm tends to retain non-noisy border points while removing nodes with instances in regions of the input space that are highly homogeneous. In experiments on 22 datasets, the RPNN had better average generalization accuracy than two other PNN models, while requiring an average of less than one-third the number of nodes. ",

This network is then fixed and used to solve future instances of the problem. Networks evolved in this way do not handle real-time interaction very well. It is hard to evolve a solution ahead of time that can cope effectively with all the possible environments that might arise in the future and with all the possible ways someone may interact with it. This paper proposes evolving feedforward neural networks online to create agents that improve their performance through real-time interaction. This approach is demonstrated in a game world where neural-network-controlled individuals play against humans. Through evolution, these individuals learn to react to varying opponents while appropriately taking into account conflicting goals. After initial evaluation offline, the population is allowed to evolve online, and its performance improves considerably. The population not only adapts to novel situations brought about by changing strategies in the opponent and the game layout, but it also improves its performance in situations that it has already seen in offline training. This paper will describe an implementation of online evolution and shows that it is a practical method that exceeds the performance of offline evolution alone. ",

However, there has been little discussion of any routing methodologies besides those already used in electronics. In this paper, a neural network routing methodology is proposed that can generate control bits for a broad range of optical multistage interconnection networks (OMINs). Though we present no optical implementation of this methodology, we illustrate its control for an optical interconnection network. These OMINs can be used as communication media for distributed computing systems. The routing methodology makes use of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) that functions as a parallel computer for generating the routes. The neural network routing scheme can be applied to electrical as well as optical interconnection networks. However, since the ANN can be implemented using optics, this routing approach is especially appealing for an optical computing environment. Although the ANN does not always generate the best solution, the parallel nature of the ANN computation may make this routing scheme faster than conventional routing approaches, especially for OMINs that have an irregular structure. Furthermore, the ANN router is fault-tolerant. Results are shown for generating routes in a 16 fi 16, 3-stage OMIN.",

In this paper clear evidence is presented that learning-based plasticity at the phenotypic level can and does produce directed changes at the genotypic level. This research confirms earlier experimental work done by others, notably Hinton & Nowlan (1987). Further, the amount of plasticity of the learned behavior is shown to be crucial to the size of the Baldwin Effect: either too little or too much and the effect disappears or is significantly reduced. Finally, for learnable traits, the case is made that over many generations it will become easier for the population as a whole to learn these traits (i.e. the phenotypic plasticity of these traits will increase). In this gradual transition from a genetically driven population to one driven by learning, the importance of the Baldwin Effect decreases. ",

Results from experiments are presented in which merlin outperforms both a system using the old strategy for performing generalization, and a traditional covering technique.

In this framework, the distance between the new and old proportion vectors is used as a penalty term. The square distance leads to the gradient projection update, and the relative entropy to a new update which we call the exponentiated gradient update (EG ).

In addition, the effects of non-coding segments on both of these representations is studied. Non-coding segments are a computational model of non-coding DNA and floating building blocks mimic the location independence of genes. The fact that these structures are prevalent in natural genetic systems suggests that they may provide some advantages to the evolutionary process. Our results show that there is a significant difference in how GAs solve a problem in the fixed and floating representations.

One operation that facilitates recognition is an early segmentation process in which features of objects are grouped and labeled according to which object they belong. Current computational systems that perform this operation are based on predefined grouping heuristics. We describe a system called MAGIC that learns how to group features based on a set of presegmented examples. In many cases, MAGIC discovers grouping heuristics similar to those previously proposed, but it also has the capability of finding nonintuitive structural regularities in images. Grouping is performed by a relaxation network that attempts to dynamically bind related features. Features transmit a complex-valued signal (amplitude and phase) to one another; binding can thus be represented by phase locking related features. MAGIC's training procedure is a generalization of recurrent back propagation to complex-valued units. ",

No explanation for this has been proposed so far. In this paper we show that the SBC does not in fact assume attribute independence, and can be optimal even when this assumption is violated by a wide margin. The key to this finding lies in the distinction between classification and probability estimation: correct classification can be achieved even when the probability estimates used contain large errors. We show that the previously-assumed region of optimality of the SBC is a second-order infinitesimal fraction of the actual one. This is followed by the derivation of several necessary and several sufficient conditions for the optimality of the SBC. For example, the SBC is optimal for learning arbitrary conjunctions and disjunctions, even though they violate the independence assumption. The paper also reports empirical evidence of the SBC's competitive performance in domains containing substantial degrees of attribute dependence. ",

This model is a Bayesian network incorporating temporal aspects, which we call a Dynamic Belief Network; it is used to reason under uncertainty about both the causes and consequences of the events being monitored. The basic dynamic construction of the network is data-driven. However the model construction process combines sensor data about events with externally provided information about agents' behaviour, and knowledge already contained within the model, to control the size and complexity of the network. This means that both the network structure within a time interval, and the amount of history and detail maintained, can vary over time. We illustrate the system with the example domain of monitoring robot vehicles and people in a restricted dynamic environment using light-beam sensor data.

We also describe an incremental method for performing cross-validation that is applicable to incremental learning algorithms including IDTM. Using incremental cross-validation, it is possible to cross-validate a given dataset and IDTM in time that is linear in the number of instances, the number of features, and the number of label values.

Two strategies that have been proposed to create the second generation of Gibbs samplers are integration and appending a second stage to the Gibbs sampler wherein the cluster locations are moved. We show that these same strategies are easily implemented for the sequential importance sampler, and that the first strategy dramatically improves results. As in the case of Gibbs sampling, these strategies are applicable to a much wider class of models.

We present several positive results in this new model. We show how to learn the intersection of two arbitrary halfspaces when membership queries near the boundary may be answered incorrectly.

Most previous models have focused on the latter factor. We match a simple integrate-and-fire model to the experimentally measured integrative properties of cortical regular spiking cells (McCormick et al., 1985). After setting RC parameters, the post-spike voltage reset is set to match experimental measurements of neuronal gain (obtained from in vitro plots of firing frequency vs. injected current). Examination of the resulting model leads to an intuitive picture of neuronal integration that unifies the seemingly contradictory \"1= p N arguments hold and spiking is regular; after the \"memory\" of the last spike becomes negligible, spike threshold crossing is caused by input variance around a steady state, and spiking is Poisson. In integrate-and-fire neurons matched to cortical cell physiology, steady state behavior is predominant and ISI's are highly variable at all physiological firing rates and for a wide range of inhibitory and excitatory inputs.

Our approach is primarily distinguished by two features: (1) the adoption of an average-case setting to model the \"typical\" labeling of a finite automaton, while retaining a worst-case model for the underlying graph of the automaton, along with (2) a learning model in which the learner is not provided with the means to experiment with the machine, but rather must learn solely by observing the automaton's output behavior on a random input sequence. The main contribution of this paper is in presenting the first efficient algorithms for learning non-trivial classes of automata in an entirely passive learning model. We adopt an on-line learning model in which the learner is asked to predict the output of the next state, given the next symbol of the random input sequence; the goal of the learner is to make as few prediction mistakes as possible. Assuming the learner has a means of resetting the target machine to a fixed start state, we first present an efficient algorithm that makes an expected polynomial number of mistakes in this model. Next, we show how this first algorithm can be used as a subroutine by a second algorithm that also makes a polynomial number of mistakes even in the absence of a reset. Along the way, we prove a number of combinatorial results for randomly labeled automata. We also show that the labeling of the states and the bits of the input sequence need not be truly random, but merely semi-random. Finally, we discuss an extension of our results to a model in which automata are used to represent distributions over binary strings. ",

We refer to the mechanism by which an animal evaluates the fitness consequences of its actions as a \"motivation system,\" and argue that such a system must evolve along with the behaviors it evaluates. We describe simulations of the evolution of populations of agents instantiating a number of different architectures for generating action and learning, in worlds of differing complexity. We find that in some cases, members of the populations evolve motivation systems that are accurate enough to direct learning so as to increase the fitness of the actions the agents perform. Furthermore, the motivation systems tend to incorporate systematic distortions in their representations of the worlds they inhabit; these distortions can increase the adaptiveness of the behavior generated.

However, in many cases the choice of an effective proposal distribution is difficult. As a remedy we suggest a method called Adaptive Proposal (AP). Although the stationary distribution of the AP algorithm is slightly biased, it appears to provide an efficient tool for, e.g., reasonably low dimensional problems, as typically encountered in non-linear regression problems in natural sciences. As a realistic example we include a successful application of the AP algorithm in parameter estimation for the satellite instrument 'GO-MOS'. In this paper we also present a comprehensive test procedure and systematic performance criteria for comparing Adaptive Proposal algorithm with more traditional Metropolis algorithms. ",

    "text": "Title: Priors, Stabilizers and Basis Functions: from regularization to radial, tensor and additive splines  \nAbstract: We had previously shown that regularization principles lead to approximation schemes which are equivalent to networks with one layer of hidden units, called Regularization Networks. In particular we had discussed how standard smoothness functionals lead to a subclass of regularization networks, the well-known Radial Basis Functions approximation schemes. In this paper we show that regularization networks encompass a much broader range of approximation schemes, including many of the popular general additive models and some of the neural networks. In particular we introduce new classes of smoothness functionals that lead to different classes of basis functions. Additive splines as well as some tensor product splines can be obtained from appropriate classes of smoothness functionals. Furthermore, the same extension that leads from Radial Basis Functions (RBF) to Hyper Basis Functions (HBF) also leads from additive models to ridge approximation models, containing as special cases Breiman's hinge functions and some forms of Projection Pursuit Regression. We propose to use the term Generalized Regularization Networks for this broad class of approximation schemes that follow from an extension of regularization. In the probabilistic interpretation of regularization, the different classes of basis functions correspond to different classes of prior probabilities on the approximating function spaces, and therefore to different types of smoothness assumptions. In the final part of the paper, we show the relation between activation functions of the Gaussian and sigmoidal type by considering the simple case of the kernel G(x) = jxj. In summary, different multilayer networks with one hidden layer, which we collectively call Generalized Regularization Networks, correspond to different classes of priors and associated smoothness functionals in a classical regularization principle. Three broad classes are a) Radial Basis Functions that generalize into Hyper Basis Functions, b) some tensor product splines, and c) additive splines that generalize into schemes of the type of ridge approximation, hinge functions and one-hidden-layer perceptrons.

    "text": "Title: On Computing the Largest Fraction of Missing Information for the EM Algorithm and the Worst\nAbstract: We address the problem of computing the largest fraction of missing information for the EM algorithm and the worst linear function for data augmentation. These are the largest eigenvalue and its associated eigenvector for the Jacobian of the EM operator at a maximum likelihood estimate, which are important for assessing convergence in iterative simulation. An estimate of the largest fraction of missing information is available from the EM iterates; this is often adequate since only a few figures of accuracy are needed. In some instances the EM iteration also gives an estimate of the worst linear function. We show that the power method for eigencomputation can be used to compute efficient and accurate estimates of both quantities. Unlike eigenvalue decomposition, the power method computes only the largest eigenvalue and eigenvector of a matrix, it can take advantage of a good eigenvector estimate as an initial value and it can be terminated after only a few figures of accuracy are obtained. Moreover, the matrix products needed in the power method can be computed by extrapolation, obviating the need to form the Jacobian of the EM operator. We give results of simultation studies on multivariate normal data showing this approach becomes more efficient as the data dimension increases than methods that use a finite-difference approximation to the Jacobian, which is the only general-purpose alternative available. fl Funded by National Institutes of Health Small Business Innovation Reseach Grant 5R44CA65147-03, and by Office of Naval Research contracts N00014-96-1-0192 and N00014-96-1-0330.

In this paper we examine how CN built from large numbers of relatively simple neuron-like units can be given the ability to handle problems that in typical multi-computer networks and artificial intelligence programs along with all other types of programs are always handled using extremely elaborate and precisely worked out central control (coordination, synchronization, switching, etc.). We point out the several mechanisms for central control of this un-brain-like sort that CN already have built into them albeit in hidden, often overlooked, ways. We examine the kinds of control mechanisms found in computers, programs, fetal development, cellular function and the immune system, evolution, social organizations, and especially brains, that might be of use in CN. Particularly intriguing suggestions are found in the pacemakers, oscillators, and other local sources of the brain's complex partial synchronies; the diffuse, global effects of slow electrical waves and neurohormones; the developmental program that guides fetal development; communication and coordination within and among living cells; the working of the immune system; the evolutionary processes that operate on large populations of organisms; and the great variety of partially competing partially cooperating controls found in small groups, organizations, and larger societies. All these systems are rich in control but typically control that emerges from complex interactions of many local and diffuse sources. We explore how several different kinds of plausible control mechanisms might be incorporated into CN, and assess their potential benefits with respect to their cost. ",

The model is based on separating the tasks of segmenting the input word sequence into clauses, forming the case-role representations, and keeping track of the recursive embeddings into different modules. The system needs to be trained only with the basic sentence constructs, and it generalizes not only to new instances of familiar relative clause structures, but to novel structures as well. SPEC exhibits plausible memory degradation as the depth of the center embeddings increases, its memory is primed by earlier constituents, and its performance is aided by semantic constraints between the constituents. The ability to process structure is largely due to a central executive network that monitors and controls the execution of the entire system. This way, in contrast to earlier subsymbolic systems, parsing is modeled as a controlled high-level process rather than one based on automatic reflex responses. ",

Belief networks provide a concise representation of general probability distributions over a set of random variables, and facilitate exact calculation of the impact of evidence on propositions of interest. Neural networks, which represent parameterized algebraic combinations of nonlinear activation functions, have found widespread use as models of real neural systems and as function approximators because of their amenability to simple training algorithms. Furthermore, the simple, local nature of most neural network training algorithms provides a certain biological plausibility and allows for a massively parallel implementation. In this paper, we show that similar local learning algorithms can be derived for belief networks, and that these learning algorithms can operate using only information that is directly available from the normal, inferential processes of the networks. This removes the main obstacle preventing belief networks from competing with neural networks on the above-mentioned tasks. The precise, local, probabilistic interpretation of belief networks also allows them to be partially or wholly constructed by humans; allows the results of learning to be easily understood; and allows them to contribute to rational decision-making in a well-defined way.

This helps in implementing either of the algorithms as improvement strategies for one algorithm can be directly transported to the other. In particular, by running the EM algorithm we know approximately how many iterations are needed for convergence of the Gibbs sampler. We also obtain a result that under conditions, the EM algorithm used for finding the maximum likelihood estimates can be slower to converge than the corresponding Gibbs sampler for Bayesian inference which uses proper prior distributions.

This viewpoint allows to reconcile the inductive logic programming paradigm with classical attribute value learning in the sense that the latter is a special case of the former. Because of this property, we are able to adapt AQ and CN2 type algorithms in order to enable learning of full first order formulae. However, whereas classical learning techniques have concentrated on concept representations in disjunctive normal form, we will use a clausal representation, which corresponds to a conjuctive normal form where each conjunct forms a constraint on positive examples.

The few ILP systems that handle real numbers mostly do so by trying out all real values that are applicable, thus running into efficiency or overfitting problems. This paper discusses some recent extensions of ICL that address these problems. ICL, which stands for Inductive Constraint Logic, is an ILP system that learns first order logic formulae from positive and negative examples. The main charateristic of ICL is its view on examples. These are seen as interpretations which are true or false for the clausal target theory (in CNF). We first argue that ICL can be used for learning a theory in a disjunctive normal form (DNF). With this in mind, a possible solution for handling more than two classes is given (based on some ideas from CN2).

Our aim is to find a better relationship between measured forces and the controlled velocity, without using a complicated (human generated) model. We followed a connectionist approach. Two learning phases are distinguished. First the learning controller is trained (or initialised) in a supervised way by a suboptimal task frame controller. Then a reinforcement learning phase follows. The controller consists of two networks: (1) the policy network and (2) the exploration network. On-line robotic exploration plays a crucial role in obtaining a better policy. Optionally, this architecture can be extended with a third network: the reinforcement network. The learning controller is implemented on a CAD-based contact force simulator. In contrast with most other related work, the experiments are simulated in 3D with 6 degrees of freedom. Performance of a peg-into-hole task is measured in insertion time and average/maximum force level. The fact that a better performance can be obtained in this way, demonstrates the importance of model-free learning techniques for repetitive robotic assembly tasks. The paper presents the approach and simulation results. Keywords: robotic assembly, peg-into-hole, artificial neural networks, reinforcement learning.",

The application at hand is character recognition: the aim is to evolve an optimal feature detector in order to aid a conventional classifier network to generalize across different fonts. To this end, a performance function and a genetic encoding for a feature detector are presented. An experiment is described where an optimal feature detector is indeed found by the genetic algorithm. We are interested in the application of cellular neural networks in computer vision. Genetic algorithms (GA's) [1-3] can serve to optimize the design of cellular neural networks. Although the design of the global architecture of the system could still be done by human insight, we propose that specific sub-modules of the system are best optimized using one or other optimization method. GAs are a good candidate to fulfill this optimization role, as they are well suited to problems where the objective function is a complex function of many parameters. The specific problem we want to investigate is one of character recognition. More specifically, we would like to use the GA to find optimal feature detectors to be used in the recognition of digits .

This paper is an edited recreation of that discussion. Its purpose is to offer advice and guidance to novice users of MCMC and to not-so-novice users as well.

Real-Valued\nAbstract: 2 Neural Network & Machine Learning Laboratory Computer Science Department Brigham Young University Provo, UT 84602, USA Email: martinez@cs.byu.edu WWW: http://axon.cs.byu.edu Abstract. Many neural network models must be trained by finding a set of real-valued weights that yield high accuracy on a training set. Other learning models require weights on input attributes that yield high leave-one-out classification accuracy in order to avoid problems associated with irrelevant attributes and high dimensionality. In addition, there are a variety of general problems for which a set of real values must be found which maximize some evaluation function. This paper presents an algorithm for doing a schemata search over a real-valued weight space to find a set of weights (or other real values) that yield high values for a given evaluation function. The algorithm, called the Real-Valued Schemata Search (RVSS), uses the BRACE statistical technique [Moore & Lee, 1993] to determine when to narrow the search space. This paper details the RVSS approach and gives initial empirical results. ",

Overviews are given in Silverman (1986) and Izenman (1991). This paper addresses the problem of univariate density estimation in a novel way. Our approach falls in the class of so called projection estimators, introduced by Cencov (1962). The orthonor-mal basis used is a basis of compactly supported wavelets from Daubechies' family. Kerkyacharian and Picard (1992, 1993), Donoho et al. (1996), and Delyon and Judit-sky (1993), among others, applied wavelets in density estimation. The local nature of wavelet functions makes the wavelet estimator superior to projection estimators that use classical orthonormal bases (Fourier, Hermite, etc.) Instead of estimating the unknown density directly, we estimate the square root of the density, which enables us to control the positiveness and the L 1 norm of the density estimate. However, in that approach one needs a pre-estimator of the density to calculate sample wavelet coefficients. We describe VISUSTOP, a data-driven procedure for determining the maximum number of levels in the wavelet density estimator. Coefficients in the selected levels are thresholded to make the estimator parsimonious. ",

This fact raises the question of whether a classifier with less restrictive assumptions can perform even better. In this paper we examine and evaluate approaches for inducing classifiers from data, based on recent results in the theory of learning Bayesian networks. Bayesian networks are factored representations of probability distributions that generalize the naive Bayes classifier and explicitly represent statements about independence. Among these approaches we single out a method we call Tree Augmented Naive Bayes (TAN), which outperforms naive Bayes, yet at the same time maintains the computational simplicity (no search involved) and robustness which are characteristic of naive Bayes. We experimentally tested these approaches using benchmark problems from the U. C. Irvine repository, and compared them against C4.5, naive Bayes, and wrapper-based feature selection methods. ",

In this paper we show that this problem is computationally intractable even in surprisingly restricted cases and even if we settle for an approximation to this probability. We consider various methods used in approximate reasoning such as computing degree of belief and Bayesian belief networks, as well as reasoning techniques such as constraint satisfaction and knowledge compilation, that use approximation to avoid computational difficulties, and reduce them to model-counting problems over a propositional domain. We prove that counting satisfying assignments of propositional languages is intractable even for Horn and monotone formulae, and even when the size of clauses and number of occurrences of the variables are extremely limited. This should be contrasted with the case of deductive reasoning, where Horn theories and theories with binary clauses are distinguished by the existence of linear time satisfiability algorithms. What is even more surprising is that, as we show, even approximating the number of satisfying assignments (i.e., \"approximating\" approximate reasoning), is intractable for most of these restricted theories. We also identify some restricted classes of propositional formulae for which efficient algorithms for counting satisfying assignments can be given. fl Preliminary version of this paper appeared in the Proceedings of the 13th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, IJCAI93. y Supported by NSF grants CCR-89-02500 and CCR-92-00884 and by DARPA AFOSR-F4962-92-J-0466.

One standard approach to learning these control rules, called behavior cloning, involves watching a perfect operator operate a plant, and then trying to emulate its behavior. In the experimental learning approach, by contrast, the learner first guesses an initial operation-to-action policy and tries it out. If this policy performs sub-optimally, the learner can modify it to produce a new policy, and recur. This paper discusses the relative effectiveness of these two approaches, especially in the presence of perceptual aliasing, showing in particular that the experimental learner can often learn more effectively than the cloning one.

Unless this value function equals the corresponding optimal value function, at some states there will be a discrepancy, which is natural to call the Bellman residual, between what the value function specifies at that state and what is obtained by a one-step lookahead along the seemingly best action at that state using the given value function to evaluate all succeeding states. This paper derives a tight bound on how far from optimal the discounted return for a greedy policy based on the given value function will be as a function of the maximum norm magnitude of this Bellman residual. A corresponding result is also obtained for value functions defined on state-action pairs, as are used in Q-learning. One significant application of these results is to problems where a function approximator is used to learn a value function, with training of the approxi-mator based on trying to minimize the Bellman residual across states or state-action pairs. When control is based on the use of the resulting value function, this result provides a link between how well the objectives of function approximator training are met and the quality of the resulting control.

Much progress has been made in methods for accessing relevant cases, and case-based reasoning is receiving wide acceptance both as a technology for developing intelligent systems and as a cognitive model of a human reasoning process. However, one important aspect of case-based reasoning remains poorly understood: the process by which retrieved cases are adapted to fit new situations. The difficulty of encoding effective adaptation rules by hand is widely recognized as a serious impediment to the development of fully autonomous case-based reasoning systems. Consequently, an important question is how case-based reasoning systems might learn to improve their expertise at case adaptation.

Such a dissociation could be the result of a competitive learning mechanism that, during development, devotes neural resources to the tasks they are best at performing. Studies of normal adult performance on face and object recognition tasks seem to indicate that face recognition is primarily configural, involving the low spatial frequency information present in a stimulus over relatively large distances, whereas object recognition is primarily featural, involving analysis of the object's parts using local, high spatial frequency information. In a feed-forward computational model of visual processing, two modules compete to classify input stimuli; when one module receives low spatial frequency information and the other receives high spatial frequency information, the low-frequency module shows a strong specialization for face recognition in a combined face identification/object classification task.

    "text": "Title: WRAPPERS FOR PERFORMANCE ENHANCEMENT AND OBLIVIOUS DECISION GRAPHS  \nAbstract: This paper introduces the idea of clearning, of simultaneously cleaning data and learning the underlying structure. The cleaning step can be viewed as top-down processing (the model modifies the data), and the learning step can be viewed as bottom-up processing (where the data modifies the model). After discussing the statistical foundation of the proposed method from a maximum likelihood perspective, we apply clearning to a notoriously hard problem where benchmark performances are very well known: the prediction of foreign exchange rates. On the difficult 1993-1994 test period, clearning in conjunction with pruning yields an annualized return between 35 and 40% (out-of-sample), significantly better than an otherwise identical network trained without cleaning. The network was started with 69 inputs and 15 hidden units and ended up with only 39 non-zero weights between inputs and hidden units. The resulting ultra-sparse final architectures obtained with clearning and pruning are immune against overfitting, even on very noisy problems since the cleaned data allow for a simpler model. Apart from the very competitive performance, clearning gives insight into the data: we show how to estimate the overall signal-to-noise ratio of each input variable, and we show that error estimates for each pattern can be used to detect and remove outliers, and to replace missing or corrupted data by cleaned values. Clearning can be used in any nonlinear regression or classification problem.",

In this paper, we apply a Winnow-based algorithm to a task in natural language: context-sensitive spelling correction. This is the task of fixing spelling errors that happen to result in valid words, such as substituting to for too, casual for causal, and so on. Previous approaches to this problem have been statistics-based; we compare Winnow to one of the more successful such approaches, which uses Bayesian classifiers. We find that: (1) When the standard (heavily-pruned) set of features is used to describe problem instances, Winnow performs comparably to the Bayesian method; (2) When the full (unpruned) set of features is used, Winnow is able to exploit the new features and convincingly outperform Bayes; and (3) When a test set is encountered that is dissimilar to the training set, Winnow is better than Bayes at adapting to the unfamiliar test set, using a strategy we will present for combining learning on the training set with unsupervised learning on the (noisy) test set.

This articles shows how gated experts can point to solutions to these problems. The architecture, also called society of experts and mixture of experts consists of a (nonlinear) gating network and several (nonlinear) competing experts. Each expert learns a conditional mean (as usual), but each expert also has its own adaptive width. The gating network learns to assign a probability to each expert that depends on the input. This article first discusses the assumptions underlying this architecture and derives the weight update rules. It then evaluates the performance of gated experts in comparison to that of single networks, as well as to networks with two outputs, one predicting the mean, the other one the local error bar. This article also investigates the ability of gated experts to discover and characterize underlying the regimes. The results are: * there is significantly less overfitting compared to single nets, for two reasons: only subsets of the potential inputs are given to the experts and gating network (less of a curse of dimensionality), and the experts learn to match their variances to the (local) noise levels, thus only learning as This article focuses on the architecture and the overfitting problem.

    "text": "Title: 248 Efficient Superscalar Performance Through Boosting  \nAbstract: The foremost goal of superscalar processor design is to increase performance through the exploitation of instruction-level parallelism (ILP). Previous studies have shown that speculative execution is required for high instruction per cycle (IPC) rates in non-numerical applications. The general trend has been toward supporting speculative execution in complicated, dynamically-scheduled processors. Performance, though, is more than just a high IPC rate; it also depends upon instruction count and cycle time. Boosting is an architectural technique that supports general speculative execution in simpler, statically-scheduled processors. Boosting labels speculative instructions with their control dependence information. This labelling eliminates control dependence constraints on instruction scheduling while still providing full dependence information to the hardware. We have incorporated boosting into a trace-based, global scheduling algorithm that exploits ILP without adversely affecting the instruction count of a program. We use this algorithm and estimates of the boosting hardware involved to evaluate how much speculative execution support is really necessary to achieve good performance. We find that a statically-scheduled superscalar processor using a minimal implementation of boosting can easily reach the performance of a much more complex dynamically-scheduled superscalar processor.

In a decision problem, two sets of parameters must generally be elicited: the probabilities and the utilities. While the prior and conditional probabilities in the model do not change from user to user, the utility models do. Thus it is necessary to elicit a utility model separately for each new user. Elicitation is long and tedious, particularly if the outcome space is large and not decomposable. There are two common approaches to utility function elicitation. The first is to base the determination of the user's utility function solely on elicitation of qualitative preferences. The second makes assumptions about the form and decomposability of the utility function. Here we take a different approach: we attempt to identify the new user's utility function based on classification relative to a database of previously collected utility functions. We do this by identifying clusters of utility functions that minimize an appropriate distance measure. Having identified the clusters, we develop a classification scheme that requires many fewer and simpler assessments than full utility elicitation and is more robust than utility elicitation based solely on preferences. We have tested our algorithm on a small database of utility functions in a prenatal diagnosis domain and the results are quite promising. ",

This estimate, which can be viewed as the maximum of a posterior probability density over the model parameters, may be susceptible to over-fitting, and contains no indication of parameter uncertainty. Also, this maximum may be unrepresentative of the posterior probability distribution. In this paper we study a method in which we optimize an ensemble which approximates the entire posterior probability distribution. The ensemble learning algorithm requires the same resources as the traditional Baum-Welch algorithm. The traditional training algorithm for hidden Markov models is an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm (Dempster et al. 1977) known as the Baum-Welch algorithm. It is a maximum likelihood method, or, with a simple modification, a penalized maximum likelihood method, which can be viewed as maximizing a posterior probability density over the model parameters. Recently, Hinton and van Camp (1993) developed a technique known as ensemble learning (see also MacKay (1995) for a review). Whereas maximum a posteriori methods optimize a point estimate of the parameters, in ensemble learning an ensemble is optimized, so that it approximates the entire posterior probability distribution over the parameters. The objective function that is optimized is a variational free energy (Feynman 1972) which measures the relative entropy between the approximating ensemble and the true distribution. In this paper we derive and test an ensemble learning algorithm for hidden Markov models, building on Neal ",

The model employs an object-based attentional mechanism for constructing and updating object representations. The model selectively enhances neural activations to serially construct and update the internal representations of objects through correlation-based changes in synaptic weights. The correspondence problem between items in memory and elements in the visual input is resolved through a combination of top-down prediction signals and bottom-up grouping processes. Simulations of the model on image sequences used in multielement tracking experiments show that reported results are consistent with a serial tracking mechanism that is based on psychophysical and neurobiological findings. In addition, simulations show that observed effects of perceptual grouping on tracking accuracy may result from the interactions between attention-guided predictions of object location and motion and grouping processes involved in solving the motion correspondence problem.

The lack of structure in a plausibility measure makes it easy for us to add structure on an as needed basis, letting us examine what is required to ensure that a plausibility measure has certain properties of interest. This gives us insight into the essential features of the properties in question, while allowing us to prove general results that apply to many approaches to reasoning about uncertainty. Plausibility measures have already proved useful in analyzing default reasoning. In this paper, we examine their algebraic properties, analogues to the use of + and fi in probability theory.

The definition of what constitutes a learning bias, however, has been typically restricted to bias provided by the input language, hypothesis language, and preference criteria between competing concept hypotheses. But if bias is taken in the broader context as any basis that provides a preference for one concept change over another, then the paradigm of failure-driven processing indeed provides a bias. Bias is exhibited by the selection of examples from an input stream that are examples of failure; successful performance is filtered out. We show that the degrees of freedom are less in failure-driven learning than in success-driven learning and that learning is facilitated because of this constraint. We also broaden the definition of failure, provide a novel taxonomy of failure causes, and illustrate the interaction of both in a multistrategy learning system called Meta-AQUA. ",

However, an impure program, which includes the Prolog cut \"!\" and not() operators, can return different answers if the rules are re-ordered. There are also many reasoning systems that return only the first answer found for each query; these first answers, too, depend on the rule order, even in pure rule-based systems. A theory revision algorithm, seeking a revised rule-base whose expected accuracy, over the distribution of queries, is optimal, should therefore consider modifying the order of the rules. This paper first shows that a polynomial number of training \"labeled queries\" (each a query coupled with its correct answer) provides the distribution information necessary to identify the optimal ordering. It then proves, however, that the task of determining which ordering is optimal, once given this information, is intractable even in trivial situations; e.g., even if each query is an atomic literal, we are seeking only a \"perfect\" theory, and the rule base is propositional. We also prove that this task is not even approximable: Unless P = N P , no polynomial time algorithm can produce an ordering of an n-rule theory whose accuracy is within n fl of optimal, for some fl &gt; 0. We also prove similar hardness, and non-approximatability, results for the related tasks of determining, in these impure contexts, (1) the optimal ordering of the antecedents; (2) the optimal set of rules to add or (3) to delete; and (4) the optimal priority values for a set of defaults.

Neural networks have been very successful in a number of signal processing applications. We discuss fundamental limitations and inherent difficulties when using neural networks for the processing of high noise, small sample size signals. We introduce a new intelligent signal processing method which addresses the difficulties. The method uses conversion into a symbolic representation with a self-organizing map, and grammatical inference with recurrent neural networks. We apply the method to the prediction of daily foreign exchange rates, addressing difficulties with non-stationarity, overfitting, and unequal a priori class probabilities, and we find significant predictability in comprehensive experiments covering 5 different foreign exchange rates. The method correctly predicts the direction of change for the next day with an error rate of 47.1%. The error rate reduces to around 40% when rejecting examples where the system has low confidence in its prediction. The symbolic representation aids the extraction of symbolic knowledge from the recurrent neural networks in the form of deterministic finite state automata. These automata explain the operation of the system and are often relatively simple. Rules related to well known behavior such as trend following and mean reversal are extracted. ",

A problem that has received less attention is how to select which algorithm to use for a given learning task. The ability of a chosen algorithm to induce a good generalization depends on how appropriate the model class underlying the algorithm is for the given task. We define an algorithm's model class to be the representation language it uses to express a generalization of the examples. Supervised learning algorithms differ in their underlying model class and in how they search for a good generalization. Given this characterization, it is not surprising that some algorithms find better generalizations for some, but not all tasks. Therefore, in order to find the best generalization for each task, an automated learning system must search for the appropriate model class in addition to searching for the best generalization within the chosen class. This thesis proposal investigates the issues involved in automating the selection of the appropriate model class. The presented approach has two facets. Firstly, the approach combines different model classes in the form of a model combination decision tree, which allows the best representation to be found for each subconcept of the learning task. Secondly, which model class is the most appropriate is determined dynamically using a set of heuristic rules. Explicit in each rule are the conditions in which a particular model class is appropriate and if it is not, what should be done next. In addition to describing the approach, this proposal describes how the approach will be evaluated in order to demonstrate that it is both an efficient and effective method for automatic model selection.

The second technique is lookahead. It is a well-known problem in ILP that a learner cannot always assess the quality of a refinement without knowing which refinements will be enabled afterwards, i.e. without looking ahead in the refinement lattice.

Early work on genetic programming demonstrated that it is possible to evolve a sequence of work-performing steps in a single result-producing branch (that is, a one-part \"main\" program). The book Genetic Programming: On the Programming of Computers by Means of Natural Selection (Koza 1992) describes an extension of Holland's genetic algorithm in which the genetic population consists of computer programs (that is, compositions of primitive functions and terminals). See also Koza and Rice (1992). In the most basic form of genetic programming (where only a single result-producing branch is evolved), genetic programming demonstrated the capability to discover a sequence (as to both its length and its content) of work-performing steps that is sufficient to produce a satisfactory solution to several problems, including many problems that have been used over the years as benchmarks in machine learning and artificial intelligence. Before applying genetic programming to a problem, the user must perform five major preparatory steps, namely identifying the terminals (inputs) of the to-be-evolved programs, identifying the primitive functions (operations) contained in the to-be-evolved programs, creating the fitness measure for evaluating how well a given program does at solving the problem at hand, choosing certain control parameters (notably population size and number of generations to be run), and determining the termination criterion and method of result designation (typically the best-so-far individual from the populations produced during the run). creates a restricted iteration-performing",

This formulation is an extension of the Boltzmann machine in which the units are not binary, but take on values on a cyclic range, between 0 and 2 radians. This measure is appropriate to many domains, representing cyclic or angular values, e.g., wind direction, days of the week, phases of the moon. The state of each unit in a Directional-Unit Boltzmann Machine (DUBM) is described by a complex variable, where the phase component specifies a direction; the weights are also complex variables. We associate a quadratic energy function, and corresponding probability, with each DUBM configuration. The conditional distribution of a unit's stochastic state is a circular version of the Gaussian probability distribution, known as the von Mises distribution. In a mean-field approximation to a stochastic dubm, the phase component of a unit's state represents its mean direction, and the magnitude component specifies the degree of certainty associated with this direction. This combination of a value and a certainty provides additional representational power in a unit. We present a proof that the settling dynamics for a mean-field DUBM cause convergence to a free energy minimum. Finally, we describe a learning algorithm and simulations that demonstrate a mean-field DUBM's ability to learn interesting mappings. fl To appear in: Neural Networks.",

Recent studies using the simple task of line bisection, a conventional diagnostic test, have proved surprisingly revealing with respect to the spatial and attentional impairments involved in neglect. In line bisection, the patient is asked to mark the midpoint of a thin horizontal line on a sheet of paper. Neglect patients generally transect far to the right of the center. Extensive studies of line bisection have been conducted, manipulating|among other factors|line length, orientation, and position.

Problem specification is given to the system by presenting if-then rules in the form of boolean conjunctions. Rules are added incrementally and the system adapts to the changing rule-base. Adaptation and data processing form two separate phases of operation. During processing the system acts as a parallel hardware circuit. The adaptation process is distributed amongst the computing elements and efficiently exploits parallelism.

Three characteristic properties of this domain are (a) very high dimensionality, (b) both the learned concepts and the instances reside very sparsely in the feature space, and (c) a high variation in the number of active features in an instance. In this work we study three mistake-driven learning algorithms for a typical task of this nature - text categorization. We argue that these algorithms which categorize documents by learning a linear separator in the feature space have a few properties that make them ideal for this domain. We then show that a quantum leap in performance is achieved when we further modify the algorithms to better address some of the specific characteristics of the domain. In particular, we demonstrate (1) how variation in document length can be tolerated by either normalizing feature weights or by using negative weights, (2) the positive effect of applying a threshold range in training, (3) alternatives in considering feature frequency, and (4) the benefits of discarding features while training.

This new approach is based on temporal coding by single spikes (respectively by the timing of synchronous firing in pools of neurons), rather than on the traditional interpretation of analog variables in terms of firing rates. The resulting new simulation is substantially faster and hence more consistent with experimental results about the maximal speed of information processing in cortical neural systems. As a consequence we can show that networks of noisy spiking neurons are \"universal approximators\" in the sense that they can approximate with regard to temporal coding any given continuous function of several variables. This result holds for a fairly large class of schemes for coding analog variables by firing times of spiking neurons. Our new proposal for the possible organization of computations in networks of spiking neurons systems has some interesting consequences for the type of learning rules that would be needed to explain the self-organization of such networks.

Direct Encoding encodes the weights for an a priori fixed neural network architecture. Cellular Encoding encodes both weights and the architecture of the neural network. In previous studies, Direct Encoding and Cellular Encoding have been used to create neural networks for balancing 1 and 2 poles attached to a cart on a fixed track. The poles are balanced by a controller that pushes the cart to the left or the right. In some cases velocity information about the pole and cart is provided as an input; in other cases the network must learn to balance a single pole without velocity information. A careful study of the behavior of these systems suggests that it is possible to balance a single pole with velocity information as an input and without learning to compute the velocity. A new fitness function is introduced that forces the neural network to compute the velocity. By using this new fitness function and tuning the syntactic constraints used with cellular encoding, we achieve a tenfold speedup over our previous study and solve a more difficult problem: balancing two poles when no information about the velocity is provided as input.",

This specificity, found in so many different tasks, supports the hypothesis that perceptual learning takes place in early visual cortical areas. In contrast, using a novel paradigm in motion discrimination where learning has been shown to be specific, we found generalization: We trained subjects to discriminate the directions of moving dots, and verified that learning does not transfer from the trained direction to a new one. However, by tracking the subjects' performance across time in the new direction, we found that their rate of learning doubled. Moreover, after mastering the task with an easy stimulus, subjects who had practiced briefly to discriminate the easy stimulus in a new direction generalized to a difficult stimulus in that direction. This generalization demanded both the mastering and the brief practice. Thus learning in motion discrimination always generalizes to new stimuli. Learning is manifested in various forms: acceleration of learning rate, indirect transfer, or direct transfer [7, 8]. These results challenge existing theories of perceptual learning, and suggest a more complex picture in which learning takes place at multiple levels. Learning in biological systems is of great importance. But while cognitive learning (or \"problem solving\") is abrupt and generalizes to analogous problems, we appear to acquire our perceptual skills gradually and specifically: human subjects cannot generalize a perceptual discrimination skill to solve similar problems with different attributes. For example, in a discrimination task as described in Fig. 1, a subject who is trained to discriminate motion directions between 43:5 ffi and 46:5 ffi cannot use this skill to discriminate 133:5 ffi from 136:5 ffi . 1 Such specificity supports the hypothesis that perceptual learning embodies neuronal modifications in the brain's stimulus-specific cortical areas (e.g., visual area MT) [1-6]. In contrast to previous results of specificity, we will show, in three experiments, that learning in motion discrimination always generalizes.

I compared the classification accuracy of the proposed algorithm to the accuracy attained by C4.5 under various noise levels. Feature induction improved the classification accuracy in noisy situations, but degraded it when there was no noise.

Higher performance can be obtained with machines, such as multiprocessors and dataflow machines, that can simultaneously follow multiple flows of control.

We prove that in the weak learning model, any algorithm using deterministic hypotheses to weakly learn a class of Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension d(n) requires ( d(n)) examples. In contrast, when randomized hypotheses are allowed, we show that fi(1) examples suffice in some cases. We then show that there exists an efficient algorithm using deterministic hypotheses that weakly learns against any distribution on a set of size d(n) with only O(d(n) 2=3 ) examples. Thus for the class of symmetric Boolean functions over n variables, where the strong learning sample complexity is fi(n), the sample complexity for weak learning using deterministic hypotheses is ( n) and O(n 2=3 ), and the sample complexity for weak learning using randomized hypotheses is fi(1). Next we prove the existence of classes for which the distribution-free sample size required to obtain a slight advantage in prediction over random guessing is essentially equal to that required to obtain arbitrary accuracy. Finally, for a class of small circuits, namely all parity functions of subsets of n Boolean variables, we prove a weak learning sample complexity of fi(n). This bound holds even if the weak learning algorithm is allowed to replace random sampling with membership queries, and the target distribution is uniform on f0; 1g n . p",

    "text": "Title: Adaptation of Genetic Algorithms for Engineering Design Optimization  \nAbstract: Genetic algorithms have been extensively used in different domains as a means of doing global optimization in a simple yet reliable manner. However, in some realistic engineering design optimization domains it was observed that a simple classical implementation of the GA based on binary encoding and bit mutation and crossover was sometimes inefficient and unable to reach the global optimum. Using floating point representation alone does not eliminate the problem. In this paper we describe a way of augmenting the GA with new operators and strategies that take advantage of the structure and properties of such engineering design domains. Empirical results (initially in the domain of conceptual design of supersonic transport aircraft and the domain of high performance supersonic missile inlet design) demonstrate that the newly formulated GA can be significantly better than the classical GA in terms of efficiency and reliability. http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~shehata/papers.html",

In this paper we examine this task from a connectionist perspective. Computational complexity arguments suggest that parallel feed-forward networks cannot perform this task efficiently. One difficulty is that, in order to distinguish the target from distractors, a combination of features must be associated with a single object. Often called the binding problem, this requirement presents a serious hurdle for connectionist models of visual processing when multiple objects are present. Psychophysical experiments suggest that people use covert visual attention to get around this problem. In this paper we describe a psychologically plausible system which uses a focus of attention mechanism to locate target objects. A strategy that combines top-down and bottom-up information is used to minimize search time. The behavior of the resulting system matches the reaction time behavior of people in several interesting tasks. ",

Nevertheless, the potential of the game is largely unrealized due to methodological hurdles in coevolutionary simulation raised by PE; versions of the game that have optimal solutions (Isaacs, 1965) are closed-ended, while other formulations are opaque with respect to their solution space, for the lack of a rigorous metric of agent behavior. This inability to characterize behavior, in turn, obfuscates coevolutionary dynamics. We present a new formulation of PE that affords a rigorous measure of agent behavior and system dynamics. The game is moved from the two-dimensional plane to the one-dimensional bit-string; at each time step, the evader generates a bit that the pursuer must simultaneously predict. Because behavior is expressed as a time series, we can employ information theory to provide quantitative analysis of agent activity. Further, this version of PE opens vistas onto the communicative component of pursuit and evasion behavior, providing an open-ended serial communications channel and an open world (via coevolution). Results show that subtle changes to our game determine whether it is open-ended, and profoundly affect the viability of arms-race dynamics. ",

The second method, based on the one used in the Kbann system, initially adds a complete set of potential new rules with very low certainty and allows neural-network training to filter and adjust these rules. Experimental results indicate that the former method results in significantly faster training and produces much simpler refined rule bases with slightly greater accuracy.",

HyperBF networks (Poggio and Girosi, 1990) constitute a mathematically well-founded framework for understanding such improvement in performance, or perceptual learning, in the class of tasks known as visual hyperacuity. The present article concentrates on two issues raised by the recent psychophysical and computational findings reported in (Poggio et al., 1992b; Fahle and Edelman, 1992). First, we develop a biologically plausible extension of the HyperBF model that takes into account basic features of the functional architecture of early vision. Second, we explore various learning modes that can coexist within the HyperBF framework and focus on two unsupervised learning rules which may be involved in hyperacuity learning. Finally, we report results of psychophysical experiments that are consistent with the hypothesis that activity-dependent presynaptic amplification may be involved in perceptual learning in hyperacuity.

M. I. Jordan, M. J. Kearns and S. A. Solla. Lawrence Erlbaum (1998). Abstract Gaussian processes provide natural non-parametric prior distributions over regression functions. In this paper we consider regression problems where there is noise on the output, and the variance of the noise depends on the inputs. If we assume that the noise is a smooth function of the inputs, then it is natural to model the noise variance using a second Gaussian process, in addition to the Gaussian process governing the noise-free output value. We show that prior uncertainty about the parameters controlling both processes can be handled and that the posterior distribution of the noise rate can be sampled from using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. Our results on a synthetic data set give a posterior noise variance that well-approximates the true variance.",

    "text": "Title: INVERSION IN TIME  \nAbstract: Inversion of multilayer synchronous networks is a method which tries to answer questions like \"What kind of input will give a desired output?\" or \"Is it possible to get a desired output (under special input/output constraints)?\". We will describe two methods of inverting a connectionist network. Firstly, we extend inversion via backpropagation (Linden/Kindermann [4], Williams [11]) to recurrent (El-man [1], Jordan [3], Mozer [5], Williams/Zipser [10]), time-delayed (Waibel at al. [9]) and discrete versions of continuous networks (Pineda [7], Pearlmutter [6]). The result of inversion is an input vector. The corresponding output vector is equal to the target vector except a small remainder. The knowledge of those attractors may help to understand the function and the generalization qualities of connectionist systems of this kind. Secondly, we introduce a new inversion method for proving the non-existence of an input combination under special constraints, e.g. in a subspace of the input space. This method works by iterative exclusion of invalid activation values. It might be a helpful way to judge the properties of a trained network. We conclude with simulation results of three different tasks: XOR, morse signal decoding and handwritten digit recognition. ",
